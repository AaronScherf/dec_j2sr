PA-00K-RBN,"USAID's Kinerja program was designed to improve local government service delivery in the health, education, and business sectors. &nbsp;Two randomized control trial impact evaluations were conducted to test: (1) district-level impacts of the program as a whole; and (2) school-level impacts of the school-based management (SBM) subactivity. &nbsp;Whereas the SBM evaluation provides reliable, attributable impact estimates, the district-level study was constrained by a number of factors identified at the outset and produced findings of limited policy relevance. &nbsp;The evaluation team found improvements across nearly all education and health indicators at the district level, though there was no evidence that positive changes were attributable to the program. &nbsp;The SBM study, however, found a number of significant improvements in intermediate outcomes: (1) better functioning school committees; (2) key school management documents more widely available; (3) more information provided to parents; and (4) parents more satisfied with schools. &nbsp;Conversely, the evaluation did not find evidence of improvements in higher-level outcomes, including school facilities, enrollment, attendance, or parental aspirations for their child's education. &nbsp;In summary, the evaluation team found evidence of positive changes and attributable impacts on governance outcomes but no clear evidence of sectoral changes due to Kinerja. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",,Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-497-A-10-00003,,4/1/2015 0:00,,Local level ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Community based delivery ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Societies in transition ~|~_©_~|~ Quality of care ~|~_©_~|~ Quality of education,Indonesia,AID-497-A-10-00003,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00KRBN.pdf,1419 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc. ~|~_©_~|~ 011117 - RTI International",,008558 - USAID.

PA-00K-C41,"The Timor-Leste Fostering Transparency Initiative's (FOTI) program worked to reduce corruption and emphasized building human and institutional capacity. FOTI was divided into six major components: (1) Anti-Corruption Commission (CAC); (2) Office of the Prosecutor General (OPG); (3) internal and external audit; (4) procurement; (5) national parliament; and (6) external watchdog and public advocacy. The primary intended purpose of this evaluation is to (1) provide lessons learned for Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste (RDTL), USAID, and other stakeholders in implementing future anti-corruption (AC) activities; (2) uphold MCC's commitment to maintaining accountability and measuring program results; and (3) provide practical lessons for current and future Threshold partners. Slight modifications to the program logic were permitted through a contract modification of the scope of work (SOW) shortly before the end of the program in December 2013. These were primarily to match the required activities to the altered contextual realities. The primary evaluation topics identified were: (1) program logic; (2) activities designed and implemented; (3) influence on changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors; and (4) sustainability &amp; lessons learned. The program was -- at least in the case of corruption survey -- able to take corrective actions that made it more responsive to the target institution's priorities. If the program had a better sense of the needs and desires of the target organizations, it seems likely that the activities would have launched more quickly and decreased the likelihood of needing to substantially modify the SOW. Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each of the evaluation topics.

PA-00K-78W,"<p>Seeking to expand the space for civil society activity in meaningful ways, the ultimate objective of the Building Local Capacity for Development (BLCD) project is to increase the organizational and technical capacity of civil society organizations (CSOs) to enable them to develop into mature and effective organizations able to fulfill their civil society public interest purposes and agendas so they may serve as relevant, effective and sustainable partners.&nbsp; The mid-term performance evaluation of the BLCD project determines the results of BLCD interventions as of Sept. 30, 2014; evaluates the progress made under each component based on established targets; and provides recommendations for adjustments and considerations for implementation of the rest of the project.&nbsp; The evaluation especially focuses on interventions and approaches that have proven to be feasible and sustainable in the toughening political context, and identify ones that provide a sound foundation for future prgramming.&nbsp; This project consisted of three main components: (1) to strengthen the organizational and technical capacities of key CSOs engaged in national, regional and community public interest agendas; (2) to develop highly professional CSO resource center(s), accessible to smaller and less capable CSOs working on public interest agendas; and, (3) to improve legal and regulatory environment frameworks to safeguard CSO enabling environments, sustainability and independent public interest agenda roles.&nbsp; The evaluation report addresses the following questions about each of the three main project components: (1) how effective are BLCD project capacity development interventions with partner CSOs; (2) which interventions in local capacity development are most effective and why; (3) how far along the road to sustainability are BLCD project partner CSOs and in what areas do they need most of the support; (4) how effective was BLCD project selection process for CSO resource centers; (5) what is the likelihood for sustainability of the selected resource centers and what support do they need to increase that likelihood; (6) how effective was BLCD project in raising awareness among key stakeholders on deficiencies in current legislation affecting civil society; and, (7) considering the changing political conditions, is there something the BLCD project could do differently in the future to achieve additional results under this component?&nbsp; Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)</p>",Also known as: Mid-term performance evaluation for the building local capacity for development (BLCD) project ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Building local capacity for development (BLCD),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-112-TO-14-00014 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-10-00002,,12/1/2014 0:00,,Local capacity building ~|~_©_~|~ Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Civil society organizations (CSO) ~|~_©_~|~ Public awareness ~|~_©_~|~ Legal reform ~|~_©_~|~ Regulations ~|~_©_~|~ Community development ~|~_©_~|~ Access to information,Azerbaijan,AID-112-C-12-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00K78W.pdf,663 KB,"003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

PA-00K-43J,"The Property Rights and Resource Governance (PRRG) program was designed to create opportunities for missions to obtain technical assistance on property rights assessments and other activities.&nbsp; Its primary objectives were to: (1) expand on the Office of Land Tenure and Property Rights (LTPR) framework and refine existing and develop new companion tools to augment the framework; (2) provide training and educational tools related to property rights; (3) develop improved knowledge management and information distribution systems; and (4) continue to provide technical assistance to missions and operating units to address property rights and develop programs supporting their operational plans.&nbsp; The evaluation encompassed all five PRRG components: (1) training (Components 1-2); (2) tools (Component 3); (3) knowledge management (Component 4); and (4) mission and operating unit buy-ins (Component 5). USAID's Office of Land Tenure and Resource Management posed ten questions, which directed the evaluation: (1) was there a change in the legal, regulatory or project framework at the project site; (2) has access to land governance institutions changed; (3) how have beneficiaries' knowledge and attitudes about land rights and tenure security changed; (4) how have power dynamics relating to land and gender changed; (5) has the project impacted beneficiary income, nutrition, and health; (6) are there any gender related differences in the achieved impacts; (7)&nbsp; what role did project design (and any changes/evolution in the design or its management) play in the program's final results; (8) what are the key determinants of success in documenting and disseminating the results of successful natural resources management (NRM) tools for greater adoption in the land tenure and property rights arena; (9) how widespread and available are resources on land tenure and land-based conflict resolution; and (10) did PRRG contribute to the field through increased knowledge?&nbsp; By all accounts, the vision of PRRG was realized.&nbsp; PRRG helped USAID clarify and encourage a progressive agenda through strengthened training programs and refinement and enlargement of the LTPR matrix and framework.&nbsp; PRRG opened the conversation on property rights to larger and larger audiences.&nbsp; The program promoted a common language and provided people with fundamental information through knowledge management products and activities and training.&nbsp; PRRG gave practitioners the opportunity to test ideas on property rights in dynamic environments, and it created new space for collecting and sharing those experiences.&nbsp; Where PRRG's results fell short of possibilities, most of those shortcomings were related to the program's unanticipated popularity or resulted from the program's pace and willingness to take chances.&nbsp; Only one major lesson from the experience leading up to PRRG -- the need to encourage the design of programs for gender equity -- appears to be a significant opportunity missed.&nbsp; Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question.

PA-00K-3Q6,"The Development Grants Program (DGP) is a competitive small grants program, established in 2008 that provides targeted support to U.S. private voluntary organizations (PVOs) and local non-government organizations (NGOs) that have limited or no experience in managing direct USAID grants. &nbsp;Successful PVO/NGO applicants receive awards (usually up to $2 millon) to implement activities in the field over a period of up to five years. &nbsp;Awards include a capacity development component providing awardees with access to resources for technical assistance and/or organizational strengthening. &nbsp;The purpose of this evaluation is to determine whether USAID and the DGP-funded projects have improved the capacity of communities to cope with climate change and advance environmental innovation and, at the same time, built the technical and institutional capacity of the partner implementing national NGOs and the private voluntary organizations (PVO)? &nbsp; The evaluation addresses the following 7 key questions examining USAID's support to its partners and the results of these projects: (1) to what extent has the program/project been successful in achieving results for its stated technical objective [and] what have been the key drivers of and limitations on performance to date; (2) how is the work of the implementing organization perceived and valued by beneficiaries; (3) to what extent has the partnership with USAID strengthened or otherwise changed the capacity (organizational, financial, technical etc.) of the implementing partner; (4) to what extent has USAID's approach supported the local organization in meeting its priorities, which may have changed over time; (5) what, if any, challenges has the implementing partner faced in meeting USAID program requirements; (6) what is the likelihood that the interventions (organizational development, technical results etc.) supported by USAID will be sustainable over the long term [and] how could the interventions have been improved to increase their long-term sustainability; and (7) what are the key strategic, programmatic, technical and managerial lessons learned that should be taken into account in similar future initiatives in the region/worldwide? &nbsp;A summary of findings states that at a programmatic level, USAID/Southern Africa's implementation of the DGP has worked well. &nbsp;The implementation modality through local NGOs has been successful and efficient and the technical and institutional capacity of the partner NGOs has been significantly enhanced. &nbsp;It is however the opinion of the evaluation team and personnel from the implementing partners that the program would have benefited from increased coordination between the different projects. &nbsp;The key findings and primary conclusions for the USAID DGP are summarized for each key result area in the evaluation report. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",No cover title ~|~_©_~|~ 'RFTOP- SOL- 674-14-000009' ~|~_©_~|~ Also known as: USAID development grants program Southern Africa phase I : performance evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Enhanced water supply and sanitation in Swaziland ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Climate change adaptation in the Lesotho highlands ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Reef rescuers ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Stepping up to sustainability,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,,,7/1/2014 0:00,,Climate change ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Gardening ~|~_©_~|~ Institutional sustainability ~|~_©_~|~ Jewelry ~|~_©_~|~ Reefs ~|~_©_~|~ Water sanitation ~|~_©_~|~ Weather,Swaziland ~|~_©_~|~ Lesotho ~|~_©_~|~ Seychelles ~|~_©_~|~ Southern Africa,674-A-00-10-00105-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 674-A-00-10-00124-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 674-A-00-10-00123-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 674-A-00-11-00015-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00K3Q6.pdf,1051 KB,040847 - DNA Economics,,012599 - USAID.

PA-00K-2WJ,"Wellness and Agriculture for Life Advancement (WALA) is a five-year Title II Multi-Year Assistance Program (MYAP) funded by USAID to prevent and mitigate food insecurity in southern Malawi. &nbsp;WALA targets the most vulnerable communities and households, ensuring holistic provision of services to the selected groups. &nbsp;In the original design, targeted groups are comprised of households that have small and marginal farms, are female-headed, host chronically ill persons (tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS), are food insecure, and/or host orphans. &nbsp;WALA is implemented in the eight most food insecure districts of southern Malawi: Nsanje, Chikwawa, Thyolo, Mulanje, Zomba, Machinga, Chiradzulu and Balaka. &nbsp;The goal of WALA is to improve the food security of 214,974 chronically food insecure households in 39 Traditional Authorities in eight districts in southern Malawi by 2014 through strategic objectives in: (1) maternal and child health and nutrition (MCHN); (2) agriculture, natural resource management (NRM), irrigation and economic activity; and (3) disaster risk reduction. &nbsp;The evaluation assessed the results of program and how the program management and implementation affected and/or supported program achievements. &nbsp;This will inform future Food for Peace and USAID development programming in Malawi. &nbsp;The specific program objectives were: (1) to carry out a comparative analysis (bivariate and multivariate) of baseline and endline surveys to assess the changes in the indicators (program result) as outlined in the indicator performance tracking table (IPTT); (2) to identify program strategies, structures, systems and interventions that contributed to or impeded the achievement of intended results of program interventions and links between inputs and results with gender focus; (3) to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of technical, managerial and resource management strategies; (4) to assess progress made in responding to the midterm evaluation recommendations; (5) to assess the synergy between various WALA program components including linkages with Government of Malawi and other development programs (e.g., Positive Action for Community Transformation (IMPACT), Water for Irrigation for Life Advancement (WILA), MCHN+), and how the linkages enhance the program performance; (6) to assess the sustainability of the program outcomes; (7) to list the major successes and challenges faced by the WALA program and how well these challenges were addressed; (8) to extract and report on lessons learned to inform future Food for Peace program designs; and (9) to make specific recommendations on improving strategies and program interventions for future programming and/or scale-up. &nbsp;Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","""A Title II MYAP Funded by USAID Food for Peace"" ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Wellness and agriculture for life advancement (WALA)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-FFP-A-09-00001,,8/1/2014 0:00,,Food for Peace Title II ~|~_©_~|~ Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Maternal child health care ~|~_©_~|~ Malnutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Child nutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Maternal nutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Disadvantaged groups ~|~_©_~|~ Crop yield ~|~_©_~|~ Poverty reduction ~|~_©_~|~ Rural areas ~|~_©_~|~ Natural resource management ~|~_©_~|~ Irrigation ~|~_©_~|~ Disaster planning,Malawi,AID-FFP-A-09-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00K2WJ.pdf,1623 KB,007337 - Catholic Relief Services (CRS),,007648 - USAID.

USAID/Guatemala, through its partners, implemented four agricultural projects intended to assist smallholder farmers in Guatemala in improving their farming practices and to provide access to national, regional, and international markets.&nbsp; The ultimate goal of these interventions was to increase employment at the local level and to make the country more competitive on the international market.&nbsp; Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for impact evaluation areas.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Cover title: Does assistance to farmers translate into community welfare improvements? : a non-experimental program evaluation of usaid assistance to smallholder farmers in Guatemala : final report ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Learning, evaluation, and analysis project (LEAP)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-C-11-00169,,8/1/2014 0:00,,Agricultural technology ~|~_©_~|~ Feasibility studies ~|~_©_~|~ Female ~|~_©_~|~ Households ~|~_©_~|~ Income ~|~_©_~|~ Literacy ~|~_©_~|~ Poverty ~|~_©_~|~ Rural areas,Guatemala,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00K2WG.pdf,2088 KB,"040314 - Optimal Solutions Group, LLC",,"013891 - USAID.

PA-00K-2VF,"This report presents the findings of the final performance evaluation of the Monitoring Nepal's Peace Process and Constitution Drafting Process (MNPPCDP) project. &nbsp;The MNPPCDP project initially conducted district-based monitoring of selected aspects of the political transition in Nepal, and then grew to include monitoring of voter registration in advance of the November 2013 Constituent Assembly (CA) elections and fielding an international mission to observe the CA elections. &nbsp; Over the span of the project, program documents associated with this project make it clear that the project was much more concerned with generating information to inform elite (""key stakeholder"") decision-making than with the wide dissemination of information to ""Nepali citizens.""&nbsp;This evaluation seeks to assess the veracity of the following inter-connected hypotheses: (1) information generated by The Carter Center's (TCC's) monitoring reached and was consumed by the intended ""key stakeholders"" (and perhaps also citizens more generally); and (2) TCC-generated information, analysis and suasion influenced the decision-making of key stakeholders in ways that contributed to sustaining the peace process. &nbsp;More specifically, the main research questions include: (1) how effective was the program in engaging women, youth, dalits, differently abled and other marginalized groups during the monitoring of peace and constitution drafting processes and in bringing their issues to influence these processes [and] do citizens feel that their voices have been heard through this program; (2) how have the findings of TCC's analytical work such as field visit reports and press releases contributed to policy level decisions and to help shape programs and strategies of stakeholders such as CSOs, USAID projects, Election Commission of Nepal (ECN), Government of Nepal and donor communities [and]&nbsp;&nbsp;what other information would have been more helpful for the stakeholders; (3) in what ways have the report on ""limited observation of the ECN's voter registration program"" contributed to strengthening Election Commission's voter registration process [and] what recommendations from TCC's 2013 CA election observation report and/or other reports are being implemented for the June 2014 by-election and future local elections; and (4) what are further opportunities and challenges for making the long-term observation process more efficient and effective? &nbsp;Evaluation conclusions were that given the political context in Nepal circa 2009-2013, a case can be made that long-term monitoring of the peace process by the Carter Center was valuable for the following reasons: (1) it addressed the lack of credible information coming from the regions; (2) given the multi-faceted nature of the peace process, there was value in having a single organization that could deal holistically with all the elements of the peace process: local level peace and security, the constitutional process and the electoral process; (3) there was an openness -- perhaps even a desire -- on the part of most key political actors to have a neutral international actor that could, in the name of the CPA, help to resolve political impasses and also help keep any one group from behaving in ways that would cause the peace process to collapse; and&nbsp;(4) President Carter had experience and credibility with most key actors and wasn't too threatening to the Indian government. &nbsp;Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","Evaluated project title: Monitoring Nepal's peace process and constitution drafting process (MNPPCDP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: DRG learning, evaluation, and research (DRG-LER)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-M-13-00013,,8/1/2014 0:00,,Constitutions ~|~_©_~|~ Elections ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Observation ~|~_©_~|~ Political participation ~|~_©_~|~ Voter registration ~|~_©_~|~ Voters ~|~_©_~|~ Voting,Nepal,AID-367-A-09-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00K2VF.pdf,571 KB,040818 - NORC at the University of Chicago,,"040194 - USAID.

PA-00K-2NV,"The Improved Basic Education in Cambodia project's strategic objective is to improve access, quality, and relevance of basic education in Cambodia.&nbsp; More specifically, the IBEC project is to increase lower secondary school enrollments, retention, and completion rates, providing Cambodia's adolescent youth population with an opportunity to be better educated and lead productive lives.&nbsp; The IBEC project targets selected schools in three provinces, Kampong Cham, Kratie and Siem Reap.&nbsp; There are four inter-related, mutually reinforcing, and complementary components to achieving this overarching goal.&nbsp; These four main components include: (1) local NGO and government capacity building &amp; advocacy for sustainability; (2) more equitable school access; (3) improved school management and community involvement; and (4) improved educational relevance.&nbsp; The development hypothesis underlying the IBEC project is that a more relevant curriculum, combined with better trained teachers and school managers would encourage more students to attend lower secondary school and to stay long enough to complete the lower secondary cycle.&nbsp; Improved physical facilities (wells for drinking water, sanitary latrines, life skills laboratories, etc.) were also believed to play a positive role in inducing students to attend and remain in school.&nbsp; In addition, a limited number of scholarships would directly help vulnerable youth obtain a quality education.&nbsp; In total, these improvements were to create a better educated youth population who will have a knowledge base more relevant to the economic needs of Cambodia, with skills more compatible with the demands of the local job market.&nbsp; The purpose of the evaluation is to assess the project's accountability and extent to which it was able to meet its intended objectives at all result levels.&nbsp; The evaluation also documents lessons learned and best practices, as well as providing recommendations to inform evidence-based future programming.&nbsp; The evaluation questions guiding this performance evaluation were: (1) to what extent did the project achieve its objectives; (2) among all the interventions implemented by the partner, identify the interventions that have been the most effective in achieving the project objectives; (3) what are key lessons learned?&nbsp; The end-of-project performance evaluation provides evidence to confirm that IBEC largely achieved its objectives to improve access, quality and relevance of basic education in Cambodia.&nbsp; Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question.

PA-00K-2JD,"This final performance evaluation was designed to assess two projects supported by USAID/Ecuador: (1) Strengthening Civil Society in Ecuador (GF Project); and (2) Strengthening Democracy in Ecuador (PC Project). &nbsp;The GF Project goal was to enhance the capacity of local CSOs to advocate for democracy-related issues and support efforts to influence legislation and policies related to the CSO sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;Specific GF Project objectives were: (1) to strengthen the capacity of CSOs to effectively influence democratic processes, institutions, and (2) to increase adherence to democratic principles to strengthen the capacity of selected CSOs to develop more effective sustainability efforts and function more transparently. &nbsp;The PF project's overall goal was to promote more effective citizen participation in key democratic processes and oversight of democratic institutions. &nbsp;The project included the following key areas of activity: (1) support of advocacy, oversight, and capacity building efforts of 24 CSOs through small grant funds; (2) strengthen a national CSO network to build CSOs' capacities and promote collective action; (3) develop research studies and publications to enhance the work of the CSO sector; (4) identify and disseminate innovative practices within the CSO sector; (5) strengthen CSOs organizationally and institutionally through direct coaching and long-term formal courses; and (6) promote CSO sustainability through hands-on development of sustainability plans. &nbsp;The evaluation was structured around four main categories of questions that apply to both projects, namely: (1) advocacy and oversight; (2) engagement; (3) local capacity development; and (4) sustainability. &nbsp;Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",Prefaced by informational memorandum ~|~_©_~|~ 'Prepared under RFTOP No. SOL-518-13-000009' ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Strengthening civil society in Ecuador (SCS)  (GF project) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Strengthening democracy in Ecuador (SD) (PC project),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,,,8/1/2014 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Civic education ~|~_©_~|~ Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Learning readiness ~|~_©_~|~ Political participation ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion ~|~_©_~|~ Transparency,Ecuador,AID-518-A-11-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-518-A-00-03-00054 ~|~_©_~|~ 518-A-00-03-00054-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00K2JD.pdf,1661 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates,,008538 - USAID.

PA-00K-2F6,"The Programme de Bonne Gouvernance (PBG) is a five-year project (2009-2014).&nbsp; PBG focused on three tracks -- civil society, parliaments and local government -- that correspond to the three Intermediate Results: (1) citizens demand accountability; (2) selected parliaments are more democratic and effective; and (3) laws, policies and procedures for decentralization are established and implemented.&nbsp; By mid-course in the project, PBG concentrated on support to revenue management by twelve Decentralized Territorial Entities (Entites territoriales decentralisees or&nbsp;ETDs) with citizen participation.&nbsp; As specified in the scope of work, the main evaluation objectives are to determine answers to the following two questions: (1) what is the performance of the program in strengthening institutions and increasing citizen demand; and (2) to what extent is the project theory of change valid that strengthened institutions and increased demand result in better service delivery? &nbsp;In addition, this performance evaluation seeks to answer the following evaluation questions: (1) do institutions have increased capacity and strength; (2) has there been an increased citizen demand for accountable governance; (3) were there improvements in delivery of public services in the target local governments; (4) what lessons have been learned regarding implementation strategies; and (5) what are findings related to cross-cutting themes of gender and urban-rural impact?&nbsp; Some key evaluation questions address the effectiveness of revenue generation among the ETDs or Decentralized Territorial Entity (Entites territoriales decentralisees), and the most effective methods to achieve these results.&nbsp; The overall evaluation conclusion is that the project was very well-managed despite a highly challenging context and vast project scope.&nbsp; It was also concluded that working with local government on a pilot basis has tentatively confirmed the fundamental principle of citizen participation for effective decentralization.

PA-00K-265,"The Ghana National Strategic Plan (NSP) for HIV and AIDS aims to reach 80% of all key populations by 2015 with a comprehensive package of HIV services, including prevention, treatment, and support.&nbsp; Under the strategy, a number of evidence-based services have been rolled out to key populations nationwide by the Ghana Aids Commission (GAC) and implementing partners.&nbsp; This evaluation, therefore, was conducted as a mid-point assessment in order to describe the achievements and challenges of the ongoing implementation of the National HIV Prevention Program for female sex workers (FSW) and men who have sex with men (MSM) in Ghana.&nbsp; This performance evaluation employed a mixed-methods approach in order to assess the following key study aims: (1) describe how services are being delivered; (2) document barriers and facilitators to accessing health services for MSM and FSW as well as the larger structural influences on sexual and health seeking behaviors such as stigma and discrimination; (3) assess whether organizations directly providing services to FSW and MSM have standard operating procedures, functional supervision mechanisms, monitoring and reporting systems, and administrative, management, and planning capacity; and (5) document efforts to increase stakeholder and organizational coordination and to address social, cultural, religious, political, and legal barriers to HIV prevention efforts among FSW and MSM.&nbsp; Study findings suggest that leadership provided by the GAC and the Technical Working Group (TWG) are strong, and while some greater capacity building and standardization could improve data collection and reporting and standardize service availability, organizations are striving to adhere to the service package and to provide a high quality product.&nbsp; This effort has resulted in high demand for services and a positive reputation for respectful treatment and confidentiality among FSW and MSM.&nbsp; Overall, recommendations focus on the ways in which the program can continue to be strengthened and expanded to better meet demand for services without sacrificing the reputation for service quality upon which that demand is predicated.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Also known as: A performance evaluation of the national HIV prevention program for female sex workers and men who have sex with men in Ghana ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: MEASURE evaluation phase III,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,GHA-A-00-08-00003-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GHA-A-00-08-00003,,7/1/2014 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Condoms ~|~_©_~|~ Crimes ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Health care costs ~|~_©_~|~ Plastics ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion ~|~_©_~|~ Sexes,Ghana,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00K265.pdf,2433 KB,000821 - University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

PA-00K-15Q,"Schools in Macedonia have traditionally been divided along linguistic lines, eliminating the opportunity for children from different ethnic and language groups to interact and develop norms of trust and reciprocity.&nbsp; Instead, separation and division threatens to reduce accurate information flow across ethnic lines and to perpetuate stereotypes about ""other"" groups.&nbsp; The Interethnic Integration in Education project&nbsp;(IIEP) acts to build broad public understanding of the benefits of an integrated educational system in Macedonia.&nbsp; It works with a variety of actors to create ""the political, social, and economic environment needed for Macedonia to achieve sustained interethnic integration in schools, in other educational institutions and eventually all of society.""&nbsp; The project is implemented through four interrelated components that target all primary and secondary schools across Macedonia and build the capacity of the Ministry of Education and Science (MoES), the Bureau for Development of Education (BDE), the State Education Inspectorate (SEI), and the Vocational Education and Training Center (VETC) to support IIE activities.&nbsp; This evaluation provides answers to two types of questions: (1) determining if the project has met its objectives and (2) recommendation questions aimed at improving the current project implementation and informing future USAID efforts in interethnic educational integration.&nbsp; Evaluation questions are: (1) what are the progress and the effectiveness of the project's interventions to date on the project objectives; (2) how well is the project communicating with beneficiaries, the Government of Macedonia, other donors, and NGOs in the area of ethnic integration; (3) does the project approach need to be modified in order to reflect the reality of current ethnic relations [and] if so, how; (4) which selected actions and/or cross-cutting themes and corresponding activities should be further emphasized, modified, or eliminated, and why; (5) what should the implementer do to ensure sustainability; and (6) what existing alternative approaches could lead to better results?&nbsp; An overall conclusion follows the detailed project component analyses.&nbsp; Considering the size and complexity of the issue that the project seeks to address -- the interethnic integration of all schools at the primary and secondary level -- the project is performing remarkably well.&nbsp; The project is relevant and responsive to the context and ethnic realities present in Macedonia today; however, the disruptive influence of politics in school life, limited financing and opportunities for fundraising for activities, the segregating nature of the education system, and the lack of concrete professional and/or financial incentives to continually motivate teachers threatens the project's sustainability in the long term.

PA-00J-ZWR,"The Judicial Strengthening Project (JSP) in Macedonia is the third in a series of USAID-funded projects focused on the judicial sector and is designed to address both the demand and supply sides of judicial independence, effectiveness, and accountability.&nbsp; The project is organized into three components: (1) to support the development of organizations outside the judicial branch to advocate for policies to enhance the rule of law and the independence of the judicial sector (demand); (2) to partially build on the Judicial Reform Implementation Project (JRIP -- second project in the series) work with leading judicial branch actors on developing policies to strengthen judicial independence and improving operations to raise the quality of court processes (supply); and (3) to continue court room automation and judicial training (supply).&nbsp; The project operates in a highly politicized environment dominated by a single party in which continued judicial branch reform is a challenge.&nbsp;&nbsp;The evaluation team sought to provide answers to the following questions: (1) what is the progress to date on the stated project results; (2) how effective has been the project approach and interventions in achieving the expected results to date; (3) how well is the project communicating and collaborating with beneficiaries and&nbsp; counterparts in the implementation of project interventions; (4) based on results to date, is the project likely to engender sustainable and systematic development impacts after USAID funding has stopped [and] what should the implementer do to ensure sustainability and transfer of know-how; (5) given the progress to date, provide recommendation if the optional one year extension of JSP should be exercised; (6) does the project approach need to be modified in order to reflect the current justice sector environment [and] if so, how; (7) which selected actions and cross-cutting themes and corresponding activities should be further emphasized, modified or eliminated and why; and (8) what alternative approaches exist which could lead to better results and greater cost efficiency?&nbsp; The team concluded that, overall, JSP met the targets under the evaluation's specified requirements, as seen in the project's monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) Plan.&nbsp; Nonetheless, the indicators included in the plan do not fully recognize or capture key project activities relevant to the overall goal of the project.&nbsp; The team concluded that targets were not very ambitious, or were tailored to match actual conditions.&nbsp; By contrast, the results are over-ambitious and at a much higher level of effect than the underlying activities could ever achieve.&nbsp; This is due in large part to the specification of results in the request for proposal and subsequent contract, which are quite difficult for USAID to change, but also to the lack of an explicit and systematically applied theory of change.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Evaluated project title: Judicial strengthening project (JSP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Democracy, human rights, and governance - learning, evaluation, and research (DRG-LER)",Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-M-13-00011,,4/1/2014 0:00,,Judicial reform ~|~_©_~|~ Access to justice ~|~_©_~|~ Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Courts ~|~_©_~|~ Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Professional training ~|~_©_~|~ Rule of law,North Macedonia,AID-165-C-12-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JZWR.pdf,576 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,"009560 - USAID.

(YYC) is a program to promote youth empowerment in Kenya.&nbsp; The goal of YYC is to address the underlying social, economic, and political factors that drive youth marginalization in Kenya.&nbsp; In so doing, YYC seeks to affect a range of outcomes related to these factors, as well as to prevent a recurrence of the violence that followed the 2007 elections in Kenya, in which youth played a significant role.&nbsp; YYC's approach is to work with young people in communities to organize themselves into groups called ""bunges.""&nbsp; In accordance with the learning and accountability objectives described in USAID's Evaluation Policy, YYC includes an independent impact evaluation to assess the impact of the program on the outcomes it seeks to influence.&nbsp; The key findings of the evaluation are as follows:&nbsp; (1) bunges tended to remain active and engaged throughout the evaluation period; (2) YYC improved relations between youth and their communities; (3) YYC was successful in terms of increasing participants' self confidence and self-esteem; &nbsp;(4) YYC led to some improvements in political engagement, but youths continue to feel alienated by political elites and the political system; (5) the impact of YYC on economic outcomes was limited; (6) important sources of benefits from YYC were the skills and lessons derived from the process of participating in the bunge; (7) youth groups such as bunges could benefit from ""mentoring"" relationships with respected members of the community; (8) youths perceived the trainings they received as part of YYC to be a particularly valuable aspect of the program, and (9) post-election violence was minimal throughout Kenya following the 2013 presidential elections, which was a major goal of YYC.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Annex volume has been appended ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Yes youth can!

PA-00J-ZK7,"Previous evaluations in Mozambique such as the one conducted by the Aga Khan Foundation in Cabo Delgado, have called attention to the low level of reading skills in the initial grades. &nbsp;To address this concern, the Ministry of Education (MINED) and USAID/Mozambique decided to collaboratively implement an intervention project, USAID/Aprender a Ler (ApaL), to improve reading skills in the early grades. &nbsp;ApaL is conceptualized as an evidence-based reading instruction program coupled with an impact evaluation (IE) designed to estimate the impact of ApaL on reading outcomes as measured by the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA). &nbsp;This is the second of four reports that comprise the Impact Evaluation of the ApaL project. &nbsp;The IE is designed as a randomized controlled trial and uses a counterfactual -- e.g., a control group similar to the treatment groups -- to estimate what would have happened without the intervention. &nbsp;The main objective of this report is to compare results obtained by students in full and medium treatment groups to those in control schools that did not have the benefit of ApaL and to attempt to answer the question of what would likely have happened without the benefit of the project. &nbsp;In addition, the report compares scores obtained at midline and at baseline and discusses the relationships between specific variables such and sex, province, location of the school and characteristics of students, teachers, directors and classrooms that could affect student performance on the early grade reading assessment (EGRA). &nbsp;In spite of the abbreviated implementation of ApaL in 2013, it appears that the project has the potential to improve student reading skills as shown by the comparisons between control and treatment groups at midline (see Tables 1 and 2). &nbsp;Major impacts are observed in second grade in letter recognition and familiar word reading. &nbsp;Third grade pattern is not as clear although letter recognition is significantly improved in Zambezia. &nbsp;The benefits accrued by the students in full and medium groups are summarized in detailed analysis in this impact evaluation report. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","""Deliverable 7"" ~|~_©_~|~ Footer title: USAID/Aprender a ler impact evaluation : midline report ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Aprender a ler (ApaL) = Learn to read ~|~_©_~|~ Portuguese ed.: PA-00J-ZK8",Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-656-TO-12-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00016 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00016-00,,2/1/2014 0:00,,Educational development ~|~_©_~|~ Reading instruction ~|~_©_~|~ Reading skills ~|~_©_~|~ Preschool education ~|~_©_~|~ Access to education ~|~_©_~|~ Basic education ~|~_©_~|~ Learning motivation ~|~_©_~|~ Learning readiness ~|~_©_~|~ Primary schools ~|~_©_~|~ Enrollment,Mozambique,AID-656-C-12-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JZK7.pdf,1483 KB,"001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

PA-00J-ZGH,"BEP is a five-year, USAID-funded education initiative designed to benefit all public primary and lower secondary schools in Kosovo. &nbsp;BEP aims to strengthen the capacity of Kosovo's teachers and schools to provide relevant skills for its students. &nbsp;Its overarching goal is to strengthen the Government of Kosovo's (GOK) institutional capacity in the education sector and improve the quality of primary education. &nbsp;The BEP program objectives consist of three interlocking components: (1) enhance school management capacities in the decentralized environment; (2) strengthen the assessment of learning outcomes; and (3) improve in-service teacher training. &nbsp;The eight evaluation questions are: (1) how has the Kosovo Education System in Kosovo been strengthened and benefited from the implementation of BEP's three (3) program assistance components [and] to what extent has the program met its three stated objectives and how effective have the program's interventions been in achieving the program's stated objectives; (2) how have the Ministry of Education and Municipal Education Departments (MEDs) in municipalities where BEP is active strengthened their gender diversity as a result of the implementation of BEP's activities [and] to what extent has the program strengthened gender diversity through its three stated objectives; (3) how successful is BEP in integrating non-Albanian ethnic minorities in its programming [and] to what extent has the program reached out to them [and] to what extent has the program reached out to Serb minority; (4) what is the current capacity and timeline for municipalities to become effective in assuming prescribed responsibilities under the Pre-University Education Law [and] how much has BEP utilized on the job training and coaching with partner municipalities (in comparison to classical training) and what are the concrete results on the ground; (5) how effectively does BEP coordinate activities with other USAID and other donors' programs; (6) based on the review of BEP's implementation and results, what recommendations are there for possible future USAID programming and/or other donors or governments in improving Kosovo education system [and] what recommendations are there for supporting the implementation of the reform process; (7) apart from current coordination, in what other ways can BEP collaborate with other ongoing USAID programs; and (8) which of the identified deficiencies in the overall implementation of the program's current objectives can be remedied in the remaining life of the program [and] what are recommendations and lessons learned? &nbsp;The evaluation team found that much has been accomplished in the BEP, particularly with respect to program outputs (e.g., the quantity of teachers and school directors trained). &nbsp;The evaluators consider Family Health International 360's (FHI 360's) leadership and personnel to be high-quality, dynamic, and energetic; they have interacted routinely and effectively with the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST), Municipal Education Department (MEDs), teachers, school directors, and other international donor organizations. &nbsp;The quality of BEP training courses, training materials, and especially BEP trainers has universally received high ratings and levels of appreciation. &nbsp;Supported by the responses in the anonymous questionnaires, the interviews and focus group discussions also provided evidence that the BEP is valued for the quality of its training and its trainers; its contribution toward professional development of teachers and a more participatory, relaxed classroom environment; its creation of training and organizational structures for improving school management capacity; and its introduction of technology into schools. &nbsp;With respect to deficiencies, a frequent complaint heard from teachers and school directors was the failure to provide certificates to teachers participating in cascade trainings at the schools. &nbsp;The teacher focus groups and site visits revealed that technology -- despite being greatly appreciated -- is probably not being used, and should probably be discontinued in favor of other low-cost, low-tech learning tools. &nbsp;Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",Evaluated project title:  Basic education program (BEP) ~|~_©_~|~ Final evaluation: PA-00M-PH2,Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-167-TO-14-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00008 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00008-00,,5/1/2013 0:00,,Basic education ~|~_©_~|~ Primary schools ~|~_©_~|~ Teacher education ~|~_©_~|~ Rural areas ~|~_©_~|~ Urban areas ~|~_©_~|~ Quality of education ~|~_©_~|~ Educational development ~|~_©_~|~ Learning readiness,Kosovo,167-A-00-10-00101-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-167-A-00-10-00101,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JZGH.pdf,951 KB,"006007 - AMEX International, Inc.",,"010393 - USAID.

PA-00J-ZD7,"The Tunisia Transition Initiative (TTI) program was designed to support Tunisians in their pursuit of a democratic society by creating viable space for the transition to succeed. &nbsp;The transition was a result of revolution in response to long-simmering grievances, including inequality among regions, the marginalization of social groups (i.e. unemployed, youth, rural women), and the highly centralized state (directly in response to the events of the Arab Spring). &nbsp;Despite disappointment in the pace of reform, many citizens still see the transition as a real opportunity to promote social modernization and democracy, strengthen civil society, give greater voice to youth and women, and rebuild regional and local governance. &nbsp;In an effort to support the transition, activities focused on civic engagement, women and youth political participation, civil society organization capacity, and countering violent extremism, among others. &nbsp;The evaluation focused in general on assessing two primary aspects of the TTI program: (1) strategic approach to programming, examining in particular the adaptability to changes in the political landscape, relevance to critical issues or events of the transition, and overall strategic targeting; and (2) the effectiveness and impact (intended and unintended) of the TTI program, primarily through the lens of TTI's four priority sub-objectives. &nbsp;Recent studies, news reports, and interviews with country experts, staff and grantees point to a rise in extremist violence throughout Tunisia, including in areas where TTI programming is being implemented. &nbsp;There is a growing concern among civil society organizations regarding what they perceive as increasing levels of anti-establishment beliefs and attitudes among youth. &nbsp;These beliefs include an alienation from the political and economic system that took over ""their revolution"" and that has not addressed corruption or unemployment. &nbsp;This dynamic speaks to cognitive radicalization processes referenced by the Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) Desk Study and Framework for the Office of Transition Initiatives/Tunisia &nbsp;(OTI/Tunisia) and further validates CVE programming. &nbsp;As such, the evaluation team found that the program is responding to an evolving context of a growing social dynamic that poses a serious threat to the political transition. &nbsp;Specific evaluation analyses on program findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided in detail. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified).",Cover title: Tunisia transition initiative final evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Tunisia transition initiative (TTI) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Program development quickly III (PDQ III),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-I-13-00007,,6/1/2014 0:00,,Societies in transition ~|~_©_~|~ Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Civic action ~|~_©_~|~ Women ~|~_©_~|~ Youth ~|~_©_~|~ Violence ~|~_©_~|~ Terrorism ~|~_©_~|~ Political reconciliation ~|~_©_~|~ Social change ~|~_©_~|~ Learning motivation,Tunisia,AID-OAA-I-13-00007,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JZD7.pdf,2068 KB,"003950 - Training Resources Group, Inc.

PA-00J-Z5Q,"The USAID supported Expanding Maternal and Newborn Survival (EMAS) program aimed at contributing to the reduction of maternal and newborn (MN) deaths in Indonesia.&nbsp; Maternal mortality in Indonesia remains substantially higher than expected in comparison with other south Asian countries having similar economies and states of development.&nbsp; Also, despite progress in reducing mortality among older infants and children, during the past decade Indonesia has not substantially reduced mortality among newborns (the first month of life).&nbsp; As a result, the country is losing momentum in its in child survival.&nbsp; The purposes of the mid-term evaluation were to: (1) assess EMAS progress in achieving the goal, objectives and planned outputs as stated in the agreement's project description and in approved workplans; (2) provide recommendations to improve EMAS program effectiveness over the remaining 2-plus year life of project; and (3) provide recommendations for USAID to consider in the design of future projects aimed at improving maternal and neonatal health in Indonesia.&nbsp; The evaluation team concludes that the approaches developed and implemented by EMAS have important potential to improve the performance of Indonesia's health services in managing the complications that are the major causes of maternal and newborn morbidity and mortality.&nbsp; To realize this potential at scale, however, EMAS needs to address critical challenges.&nbsp; One is to identify the connection between the process changes that EMAS has succeeded in generating with improvement in patient outcomes.&nbsp; Equally important is strengthening communication and connection with the government of Indonesia (GOI) -- especially the Ministry of Health -- at the central level.&nbsp; EMAS also needs to work with USAID, the GOI, and other stakeholders to develop a strategy for implementation at scale that goes beyond its direct engagement, to link its results with national-scale initiatives and programs.

Yaajeende has introduced new products, technologies, and innovations to strengthen food security in its intervention zones. &nbsp;Achieving higher production efficiency has been at the core of this initiative. The project has used diverse approaches to promote adoption and dissemination of new technologies, practices, and behaviors - and these approaches have been highly effective. &nbsp;Yaajeende has made a considerable effort to ensure the sustainability of its vehicles and approaches to promote adoption and dissemination of these more efficient innovations.&nbsp; Such efforts are reflected in key informant interviews and focus-group discussions with stakeholders. &nbsp;However, more rigorous empirical evidence would have better demonstrated the likelihood of project sustainability. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</span></p>",French ed.: PA-00J-Z5D,Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-685-O-14-00029,,6/1/2014 0:00,,Agricultural development ~|~_©_~|~ Malnutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Food production ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural markets ~|~_©_~|~ Nutrition improvement ~|~_©_~|~ Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Value chains ~|~_©_~|~ Economic growth ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Rural areas ~|~_©_~|~ Transportation infrastructure ~|~_©_~|~ Social change,Senegal,685-A-00-10-00002-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JZ5C.pdf,2439 KB,009456 - Chemonics International Inc.,,008600 - USAID.

PB-AAA-655,"To address the deficit in government justice services and reduce the incidence of social practices that Afghans themselves recognize as harmful to their communities, USAID developed the Rule of Law Stabilization Program - Informal Component (RLS-I).&nbsp; RLS-I addresses the primary objectives of: (1) strengthening Traditional Dispute Resolution (TDR) mechanisms, (2) enhancing linkages between the formal and informal systems, and (3) facilitating the resolution of longstanding and destabilizing disputes.&nbsp; These program objectives fall under broader United States Government (USG) rule of law and stabilization objectives and follow the development hypothesis that efforts at improving and strengthening TDR will increase stability in the project districts, where stability is indicated by perceptions of increased access to justice, increased confidence in TDR mechanisms, and a decrease in longstanding, potentially destabilizing disputes.&nbsp; The following key findings of the Phase 3 evaluation build on Phase 2 evaluation findings covering the period of October 2011-September 2012.&nbsp; There are both continuities and differences across each evaluation round, both of which provide insight into the programmatic setting and trajectory of RLS-I outcomes and impacts.&nbsp; The primary lessons provided by this research effort demonstrate the link between elder capacity building and improved disputant perception predicted by the RLS-I development hypothesis, show that regional differences in program setting are associated with differences in outcomes, and suggest a possible J-curve&nbsp; impact trajectory where RLS-I may raise community (evaluation respondents) expectations before program participants have fully adopted RLS-I learning content and disputants witness positive changes in elders' adjudication practice.

PA-00J-XPM,"While traditional dispute resolution (TDR) mechanisms have been remarkably resilient over the past 30 years in Afghanistan, decades of conflict have weakened TDR capabilities in many areas by disrupting the informal justice institutions through which elders and other locally legitimate actors adjudicate disputes.&nbsp; Lack of access to justice, whether it comes from formal or informal providers, is a source of instability that USAID Afghanistan is addressing through programs such as Rule of Law Stabilization - Informal Component (RLS-I).&nbsp; The RLS-I program was designed to achieve the following three objectives: (1) strengthen TDR mechanisms; (2) strengthen linkages between informal and formal justice sectors; and (3) develop approaches that successfully resolve long-term intractable disputes.&nbsp; This evaluation measured the achievements and challenges of RLS-I in six provinces of Afghanistan: Baghlan, Faryab, Kandahar, Nangarhar, Uruzgan and Wardak.&nbsp; A set of mixed quantitative and qualitative methods were used for data collection.&nbsp; The evaluation found strong performance on some RLS-I program objectives and weaker performance on others.&nbsp; Direct beneficiaries that participated in training activities for TDR actors -- a central facet of the RLS-I program -- noted general satisfaction with the training experience and reported gaining valuable knowledge of legal principles and procedural justice.&nbsp; These TDR actors also seemed to put their training to good use, a significant majority of the indirect beneficiary population reported that the quality of traditional justice had improved compared to before the RLSI program.&nbsp; Further, direct and the indirect beneficiary population alike reported a reduction in the incidence of cultural practices that are harmful to women such as baad (the exchange of daughters to settle disputes or debts).&nbsp; Confidence in the ability of TDR actors to resolve disputes generally increased, though this strengthening of TDR mechanisms was not accompanied by a perceived strengthening of the formal justice system or a greater rate of referrals of cases from traditional to formal justice providers.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Also known as: Rule of law support-informal final evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Rule of law stabilization-informal component (RLS-I),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-306-O-14-00051,,5/1/2014 0:00,,Artists ~|~_©_~|~ Business enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Litigation ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion ~|~_©_~|~ Rule of law ~|~_©_~|~ Violence against women ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Afghanistan,AID-306-C-12-00013,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JXPM.pdf,2640 KB,040788 - Sayara Research,,008504 - USAID.

PA-00J-XGB,"The USAID/Nicaragua Health Program (2008-2013) worked to achieve a more educated and healthy population with a greater ability to contribute to and share the benefits of a growing economy and strengthen the health sector of Nicaragua (e.g. public and private sectors, NGOs, universities and communities) by providing technical and financial assistance.&nbsp; The purpose of this evaluation was to: (1) determine the extent to which the objectives of the program were met and their contribution to the gender approach; (2) to evaluate the implementation of the mid-term (2007) evaluation recommendations; and (3) to identify the key factors that contributed to or prevented achieving the proposed results.&nbsp; In general, during the period studied, Nicaragua has made significant progress in family planning and maternal and child health.&nbsp; The Government of Nicaragua-led implementation of health policies, plans and strategies, coupled with the harmonization and coordination of international health cooperation (including USAID cooperation), has contributed to progress in the main demographic and maternal and child health indicators: (1) total fertility rate (TFR); (2) maternal mortality rate (MMR); (3) mortality rate (MR) in children under 5 years of age; (4) infant mortality rate (IMR); (5) neonatal mortality rate (NMR); and (6) chronic malnutrition (CM) in children under 5 years of age.&nbsp; In the case of HIV/AIDS, as expected, increasing the coverage of counseling and voluntary testing in key populations has increased the disease's prevalence and incidence, but has reduced its lethality and mortality.&nbsp; As this report shows, implementing the Family and Community Health Model (MOSAFC) has been fundamental to the country's health achievements, especially the role of the Family, Community and Life Committee (GFCV), which is the cornerstone of Ministry of Heath (MINSA) health promotion and prevention work.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","""Period December 2008-January 2013"" ~|~_©_~|~ Footer title: USAID/Nicaragua: health program performance for the 2008-2013 period ~|~_©_~|~ Also known as: USAID/Nicaragua health program performance evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health tech bridge III (GH tech bridge 3) ~|~_©_~|~ Mid-term evaluation: PB-AAB-115",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-C-13-00032,,6/1/2014 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Child malnutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Cooperation ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Family health care ~|~_©_~|~ Gender equality ~|~_©_~|~ USAID,Nicaragua,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JXGB.pdf,10155 KB,"011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

PA-00J-W27,"Kenya Dairy Sector Competitiveness Program &nbsp;(KDSCP) worked in eight milkshed locations across the Central and Rift Valley provinces. &nbsp;The program's primary goal was to increase smallholder household incomes through the sale of quality milk. &nbsp;Its secondary goal was to help transform the Kenyan dairy industry into a globally competitive and regional market leader by eliminating inefficiencies and lowering production and processing costs throughout the dairy value chain, while working to ensure that Kenyan milk met domestic and international quality standards. &nbsp;Thus, the program aimed to improve the competitiveness of Kenya's dairy industry and increase economic benefits to stakeholders throughout the entire dairy value chain, with an emphasis on smallholder farmers. &nbsp;It also integrated the crosscutting themes of gender and youth and sustainable resource management and utilization. &nbsp;The project implements three activities that focus on primary value chain constraints and opportunities: (1) KDSCP works to improve the business operating environment by building the capacity of institutions that serve the dairy industry and facilitating a review of national policies, regulations, acts, and standards to ensure consumer safety and market expansion, especially for the export market; (2) KDSCP works to increase the operational efficiency of small business organizations in the industry, particularly those serving farmers working directly with the program; and (3) KDSCP supports increased access to business development services by dairy enterprises, including smallholder farmers. &nbsp;The evaluation team was required to respond specifically to five questions posed by USAID in the evaluation statement of work (SOW): (1) to what extent did KDSCP meet the intended goals [and] if the goal was not achieved, why not; (2) what were the internal and external enabling factors that contributed to meeting or not meeting the intended goals; (3) what is the evidence concerning the sustainability of the end results produced by the program; (4) to what extent did the program employ new approaches; and (5) to what extent were environmental compliance mitigation measures identified at the beginning of the project effectively implemented, including Pesticides Evaluation Reports and Safe Use Action Plans? &nbsp;The following are lessons learned from the implementation of KDSCP and the project evaluation: (1) artificial insemination is an excellent means for small dairy farmers to progressively improve the genetic foundation of their dairy herd to increase milk production and create greater market value for their dairy cattle; (2) providing adequate quantities of nutritious feed and water to dairy cattle throughout the dry season will mitigate the effects of seasonal declines in milk production; (3) on-farm silage making is a low-cost means for preparing and storing animal feed by small farmers; and (4) to better collect information, USAID evaluations should be conducted before the project is completed. &nbsp;Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",'Kenya Support Program' ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Kenya dairy sector competitiveness program (KDSCP),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-623-TO-13-00015 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-623-I-12-00001,,7/1/2013 0:00,,Agriculture ~|~_©_~|~ Diseases ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Economics ~|~_©_~|~ Marketing ~|~_©_~|~ Nutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Property,Kenya,623-C-00-08-00020-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-623-C-00-08-00020,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JW27.pdf,1926 KB,"003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

PA-00J-VKC,"In 2008, USAID procured two HIV Testing and Counseling (HTC) projects, Angaza Zaidi and Universal HIV and AIDS Intervention for Counseling and Testing (UHAI-CT), both with indicators and targets aimed at contributing to increased use of HIV/AIDS prevention to care services and products. &nbsp;The primary goal of the Angaza Zaidi project is to improve the health of Tanzanians by ensuring that they know their HIV status, take steps to protect themselves, and have better quality of life if infected. &nbsp;The Angaza Zaidi technical approach uses three modalities: (1) integrated voluntary HTC; (2) stand-alone HTC; and (3) community-based HTC. Implementation is guided by strategies of: (1) targeting; (2) decentralization and community engagement; (3) branding; (4) partnerships and sub-granting; (5) advocacy; and (6) counseling and testing systems strengthening. &nbsp;The primary goal of the UHAI-CT project is to increase access to testing and counselling services to Tanzanian families, couples, and individuals, particularly those at high risk, and to link those found to be HIV-positive to relevant HIV care, treatment, and prevention services. &nbsp;The UHAI-CT technical approach is guided by the principles of: (1) innovation; (2) rapid expansion; (3) diversity of strategies; (4) quality; (5) sustainability; (6) strong links to HIV care; and (7) treatment and cost effectiveness. &nbsp;UHAI-CT activities are implemented using Providor Initiated Testing and Counseling (PITC) and community outreach. &nbsp;Main questions for this program evaluation were the following: (1) has each project achieved its stated goals and objectives; (2) what are each project's strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in planning, management, routine data use, and service delivery; (3) how did each project strategically use different HTC modalities to achieve its goals and objects [and] were these modalities effective in reaching the target populations [and] what are the lessons learned from successful interventions that merit continuation or replication, better practices, significant products and tools for possible dissemination and replication; (4) was each project able to successfully refer newly-identified HIV-positive clients to HIV care and treatment facilities [and] what systems were used during these referrals; (5) how has each project built capacity and/or institutionalized its practices to heighten opportunities for sustainability [and] were these efforts successful. &nbsp;The evaluation team concludes that both projects met many, but not all, of their objectives and targets. &nbsp;Although the evaluation documents several weaknesses, both projects had more strengths than weaknesses. &nbsp;While all of the HTC modalities played a significant role in increasing HTC and reaching different populations, they were not used strategically to reach populations at high risk. &nbsp;Among a number of key lessons learned by both projects is the necessity for a decentralized approach to project management in Tanzania to facilitate project monitoring, communication, and stakeholder engagement. &nbsp;Neither project created a robust, traceable linkage system to ensure HIV-positive clients are linked to care and treatment. &nbsp;However, both projects made measurable progress towards building the capacity of local institutions and institutionalizing practices for HTC.

PA-00J-TJJ,"The poverty reduction by increasing the competitiveness of enterprises (PRICE) project was implemented between 2008 and 2013 and follows several other USAID enterprise development projects. &nbsp;The main objective of this program was to reduce poverty sustainably by increasing enterprise competitiveness across three main sectors in Bangladesh: horticulture, aquaculture, and leather. &nbsp;Specific PRICE objectives across the three sectors included improving pro-poor economic opportunities, workforce skills, social compliance practices, governance practices related to economic growth and poverty reduction, small and medium enterprise (SME) development, growth of the non-textile private sector, and the capacity and use of knowledge management systems. &nbsp;The purpose of the PRICE final performance evaluation is to assess the effectiveness of the PRICE project in achieving its program objectives, to evaluate any constraints to achieving expected results, and to provide recommendations and lessons learned for future private-sector competitiveness and value chain development programs. &nbsp;There were six&nbsp;questions guiding the evaluation process: (1) how successful has PRICE been in increasing sector competitiveness and removing constraints at the local, national, and international levels and is success limited to a few PRICE beneficiaries/enterprises and selected geographic locations; (2) as suggested in the mid-term evaluation, how has PRICE improved the value chain market linkages to complement its production focus; (3) how did the project extension and 2011 re-alignment of PRICE's focus to support horticulture in the Feed the Future region affect PRICE's effectiveness and results achievement; (4) are women more empowered across the three value chains than they otherwise would have been as a result of the PRICE interventions and what has been the impact of PRICE interventions and trainings in creating jobs for women in the value chains; (5) how effective have the SME and workforce development initiatives by PRICE been in the leather sector growth; and (6) what institutional capacity-building lessons learned from PRICE should USAID carry forward to future value chain, hunger, and poverty alleviation investments? &nbsp;The conclusion of key findings summarizes the PRICE project as an overall success, with significant improvements made in increasing competitiveness in the horticulture, aquaculture, and leather sectors in Bangladesh. &nbsp;Many goals were achieved, and future projects can build on PRICE's established practices. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","Evaluated project title: Poverty reduction by increasing the competiveness of enterprises (PRICE) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Learning, evaluation, and analysis project (LEAP)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-C-11-00169,,1/1/2014 0:00,,Agricultural occupations ~|~_©_~|~ Farmers ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Gender equity ~|~_©_~|~ Manufacturing ~|~_©_~|~ Rural areas ~|~_©_~|~ Value chains ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Bangladesh,388-C-00-08-00021-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JTJJ.pdf,1914 KB,"040314 - Optimal Solutions Group, LLC",,"013891 - USAID.

RAIN's experience has demonstrated that even when environmental, economic, political and social conditions are stressed, market systems are dynamic and continue to operate in the stressed state.&nbsp; In addition to this, it has shown that even in the most complex and strained environments, if market systems are supported to overcome key obstacles, the private sector responds to opportunities and incentives to bring change to markets that work for the poor.&nbsp; This experience also indicates that&nbsp; subsidized service provisions have a distorting effect, undermining the viability of existing or emerging private sector investment.&nbsp; In order to prevent this, relief operations should be designed to meet immediate needs while minimizing distortions, avoiding undermining long-term programming and contributing to positive market system change, if possible.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Project title: Revitalizing agricultural/pastoral incomes and new markets for enhanced resilience and recovery (RAIN+) ~|~_©_~|~ Earlier project title: Revitalizing agricultural/pastoral incomes and new markets (RAIN),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,DFD-A-00-09-00087-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-DFD-A-00-09-00087,,2/1/2014 0:00,,Agricultural production ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Drought damage ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Income ~|~_©_~|~ Livestock ~|~_©_~|~ Rain ~|~_©_~|~ Rural areas,Ethiopia,DFD-A-00-09-00087-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-DFD-A-00-09-00087,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JSRQ.pdf,1467 KB,013649 - Mercy Corps,,000624 - USAID.

PA-00J-RPM,"In response to Zimbabwe's critical health status and the degraded state of the country's water infrastructure, USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA) funded 12 projects related to the Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene Promotion (WASH) sector in schools, hospitals, and clinics across the country.&nbsp; These water supply intervention activities began in fiscal year (FY) 2009 and continued through FY 2012 to determine whether they provided adequate access to improved water during the rainy and dry seasons.&nbsp; Additionally, the evaluation examined the sustainability of water supply infrastructure in various locations, including households and schools.&nbsp; This evaluation assesses five issue areas encompassing 20 specific evaluation questions with support from information gathered during dry and rainy season field visits (July and December 2013, respectively) and a thorough document review.&nbsp; The five areas are: (1) overall performance and impact; (2) efficiency; (3) coverage and design; (4) sustainability; and (5) gender equality and equity.&nbsp; The major issues influencing the achievement or non-achievement of the objectives include the following: changes in rain patterns; sharing of water sources; using water for purposes other than drinking or hand washing.&nbsp; Regarding impact, the evaluation team discovered during the field visits that many households in urban areas use multiple sources.&nbsp; This unexpected finding made it difficult to determine the contribution of the USAID/OFDA-funded sources to an improved water supply.&nbsp; The evaluation team concludes that the overall performance of the funded water supply projects in the service levels evaluation indicates that none of the water sources, on average, provides a basic level of service.&nbsp; Water quality, reliability, and quantity are the areas of particular challenge for the interventions.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",'Multiple interventions to improve water supply',Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-TO-13-00024 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00019-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00019,,3/1/2014 0:00,,Households ~|~_©_~|~ Land use ~|~_©_~|~ Rural areas ~|~_©_~|~ Seasons ~|~_©_~|~ Water pollution ~|~_©_~|~ Water sanitation ~|~_©_~|~ Water supply ~|~_©_~|~ Wells,Zimbabwe,AID-OFDA-G-10-00038 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OFDA-G-11-00154 ~|~_©_~|~ DFD-G-00-09-00105-00 ~|~_©_~|~ DFD-G-00-09-00062-00 ~|~_©_~|~ DFD-G-00-09-00323-00 ~|~_©_~|~ DFD-G-00-09-00065-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OFDA-G-10-00006 ~|~_©_~|~ DFD-G-00-09-00202-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OFDA-G-10-00056 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OFDA-G-12-00052 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OFDA-G-12-00175,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JRPM.pdf,4091 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,"000624 - USAID.

PD-ACY-328,"<div>IUWASH (Indonesia Urban Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) is a five-year USAID-funded programme whose core objective is a significant increase of access to safe water supply and improved sanitation1 in Indonesia's urban areas, with a particular focus on facilitating better access to these services for the urban poor. &nbsp;This core objective is defined by the following four high-level targets: (1) access of additional 2,000,000 people in urban areas to safe water supply; (2) access of additional 250,000 people in urban areas to improved sanitation facilities; (3) the unit cost of safe water paid by the poor in targeted communities to decrease by at least 20 per cent; and (4) 75,000 additional people to be trained in IUWASH activities. &nbsp;Three main technical components are defined as the means towards achieving these targets: (1) demand mobilisation; (2) improvement and expansion of capacity; and (3) strengthening the policy and financial enabling environments. &nbsp;The programme currently covers a total of 52 water utilities (PDAMs), of which 19 are in cities (kota) 31 in regencies (kabupaten, one is regional3 and one provinical4, plus sanitation in 54 local governments, of which 21 in kota and 33 kabupaten, These are located in five IUWASH regions: Banten/West Java, Central Java, East Java, North Sumatra and Eastern Indonesia. &nbsp;The objectives of the review itself are two: (1) a determination of whether the IUWASH contractor is meeting the expected results and outcomes agreed to in the Project Monitoring Plan (PMP); and (2) an estimate of the extent to which the development hypothesis is valid. &nbsp;The Statement of Work5 (SOW) asks three lead evaluation questions (LEQs) in terms of finding out whether these objectives are being met, to each of which a series of supplementary questions (SEQs) is appended. &nbsp;Findings and, where appropriate, recommendations for mid-term correction are provided in the three sections following this first section. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</div>","Project title: Indonesia urban water, sanitation and hygiene (IUWASH) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title also known as: USAID Indonesia urban water, sanitation and hygiene ~|~_©_~|~ Final evaluation: PA-00M-G4Q",Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-497-C-11-00001,,2/1/2014 0:00,,Urban areas ~|~_©_~|~ Sanitation ~|~_©_~|~ Hygiene ~|~_©_~|~ Water quality ~|~_©_~|~ Water management ~|~_©_~|~ Local level ~|~_©_~|~ Water supply ~|~_©_~|~ Governance,Indonesia,AID-497-C-11-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACY328.pdf,555 KB,"006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

PA-00J-RCZ,"The Comprehensive Partnership between the United States and Indonesia identifies the creation of education partnerships as a top priority. In furtherance of this objective, USAID/Indonesia launched the University Partnerships (UP) program in December 2009 to help improve the quality and relevance of higher education in Indonesia.&nbsp; This evaluation of the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth partnership awards was the third of four sets of evaluations of the partnerships.&nbsp; The topics of the four partnerships evaluated were: (1) UP#5 -- adaptation to climate risk in Indonesia; (2) UP#6 -- strengthening health systems in Indonesia: (3) UP#7 -- Indonesian marine biotechnology; and (4) UP#8 -- supporting Indonesian geothermal education capacity building.&nbsp; The purposes of the evaluation were to: (1) assess the extent of the knowledge and skills transfer that has occurred between the lead U.S. university and the Indonesian partners as subawardees; (2) determine the extent or level of the capacity building that has taken place within the partnerships; (3) assess the effectiveness of the project interventions between the partners to improve teaching and research services; (4) assess whether the projects are sustainable and have achieved project objectives; (5) obtain lessons learned from the partnerships that can be applied to the future direction of the UP program; and 6) demonstrate how institutions have achieved measurable improvements in the quality and relevance of their teaching and research.&nbsp; The evaluation team was asked to address the following five questions: (1) what are the specific knowledge and skills and the institutional capacity building that have occurred as a result of the partnership; (2) what were the project interventions that were effective between the participating universities; (3) what unintended results have occurred; (4) what are the lessons learned from the partnership that may be replicated in future programs; and (5) what are the strengths and weaknesses of the partnerships?&nbsp; Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question.

PA-00J-R8J,"This is an evaluation of the performance and lessons from the Program for Appropriate Technology in Health's (PATH) implementation of the TB TO 2015 Program since 2009. &nbsp;The main objectives were to determine if USAID-supported interventions increased TB case notification and successful treatment in the targeted areas. &nbsp;The purpose was to evaluate project performance with special attention to advocacy, communication, and social mobilization (ACSM) activities and to formulate recommendations to USAID for future TB projects. &nbsp;The report is based on: (1) review of planning documents and reports from USAID, PATH, national programs, and other sources; (2) interviews with staff and partners; and (3) observations from site visits in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. &nbsp;The main questions the evaluation was to answer were: (1) whether TB TO 2015 is on track to meet the expected results; (2) the extent to which the project was effective in achieving objectives; (3) factors for success and shortcomings; and (4) which priorities and steps USAID should consider in future projects to support TB control. &nbsp;The evaluation found that, in general, implementation of the project was considered on track, though there were varying delays in some countries. &nbsp;Weaknesses mentioned in interviews were: (1) insufficient interaction of USAID with national programs before preparing the plan of action to harmonize USAID project priorities with the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) perceived needs; (2) short-term financing that interfered with recruitment; and (3) insufficient communication with consortium partners about progress in country support. &nbsp;USAID and PATH staff interviewed both expressed concern about delays in launching activities, mostly because multiple layers of approval were required from national and international agencies. &nbsp;Field observation in Tanzania showed the excellent collaboration with national staff at all levels and with community organizations, and the consistency of laboratory and patient records with data in the reports. &nbsp;In conclusion, the TB TO 2015 Project seems to be on track to achieve its operational objectives in terms of all the key components listed, and it also seems to be a very good investment of USAID support that will have lasting impact on TB control globally as well as in some of the countries involved. &nbsp;It is too early to assess the epidemiologic objective of reducing TB prevalence and burden of disease; and the strategies used as models (the Stop TB Strategy and MDR-TB Global Response Plan 2007&ndash;08) do not prioritize interruption of transmission (screening suspects with microscopy, IPC, control of contacts) or prevention of MDR-TB, concentrating instead on patient management. &nbsp;ACSM has been successfully used to support TA and to build national capacity. &nbsp;Technical assistance quality was good, and coordination with and support to the NTPs were in general excellent. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","""Evaluation of the Activities, Operational Results, and Impact of USAID Support to TB Control through Task Order 2015 from 2009 to 2013 and Lessons Learned"" ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health technical assistance project bridge IV (GH Tech IV)",Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-C-13-00113,,11/1/2013 0:00,,Tuberculosis ~|~_©_~|~ Disease treatment ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Community mobilization ~|~_©_~|~ Advocacy ~|~_©_~|~ Communication channels ~|~_©_~|~ Multidrug-resistant/extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/XDR-TB) ~|~_©_~|~ Health care systems ~|~_©_~|~ Human capacity development,Tanzania,GHN-I-01-09-00006-00 ~|~_©_~|~ GHN-I-00-09-00006-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GHN-I-01-09-00006 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GHN-I-00-09-00006,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JR8J.pdf,609 KB,"011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

PA-00J-R44,"The Nicaragua Media Program (NMP) was implemented during the period of July 12, 2010-July 12, 2013 by FHI 360. &nbsp;NMP was a cross-cutting program that sought to strengthen the viability of independent media in Nicaragua while improving its ability to produce and disseminate quality information supporting USAID development programs. &nbsp;NMP assisted media outlets in 12 cities and two autonomous regions where other USAID development programs are being implemented. &nbsp;The program's objective was to help independent media outlets improve their content and production quality. &nbsp;Support involved providing grants, each ranging from $10,000 to $15,000, to media outlets and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). &nbsp;NMP sought to advance U.S. interests and universal democratic and human rights through public diplomacy and support for independent media. &nbsp;The program reinforced the mission's goals of: (1) empowering NGOs; (2) promoting economic growth, with equity to private sector-led growth and market-led agriculture; (3) implementing the Dominican Republic-Central America-United States Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA-DR); (4) supporting at-risk youth; (5) preventing school drop-out; promoting reading to children; and (6) supporting democratic governance and citizen participation. &nbsp;NMP was integral to USAID/Nicaragua's Strategic Objective 1 of Ruling Justly: More Responsive, Transparent Governance. &nbsp;The evaluation of NMP was conducted during the period of July-August 2013, by a team assembled by Mendez, England &amp; Associates (ME&amp;A). &nbsp;The evaluation team consisted of two experts -- one international and one local -- both with experience in the media sector. &nbsp;The main objective of the evaluation was to provide an objective review of NMP in strengthening the viability of independent media in Nicaragua while also improving its ability to produce and disseminate quality information supporting USAID development programs. &nbsp;An integral part of the evaluation mission was to answer a set of pre-determined questions. &nbsp;The findings and conclusions reached will be used to help USAID/Nicaragua make management decisions in a changing political environment and whether, when, and how to continue future support to the Nicaraguan media sector. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",'Prepared under RFTOP No. SOL-524-13-000004' ~|~_©_~|~ Translated title provided by submitter ~|~_©_~|~ Submitted as: Nicaragua media program final performance evaluation report ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Nicaragua media program (NMP),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,,,9/1/2013 0:00,,Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Investment ~|~_©_~|~ Management ~|~_©_~|~ Mass media ~|~_©_~|~ Newspapers ~|~_©_~|~ Television ~|~_©_~|~ USAID,Nicaragua,AID-524-LA-10-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JR44.pdf,725 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates,,008584 - USAID.

PA-00J-R3N,"The Liberia Energy Sector Support Program (LESSP) was designed by USAID/Liberia to increase access to affordable renewable energy services in geographically focused rural and urban areas in order to foster economic, political and social development.&nbsp; LESSP interventions were designed to effect the following changes in Liberia: (1) increased, sustainable access and affordability of electricity within urban and rural poor communities; (2) improved performance of local governments, civil society and the private sector in monitoring, regulating and managing the use of renewable energy; (3) an increase in the percentage of households and businesses utilizing clean energy, and a corresponding increase in economic activity; and (4) policy changes that improve the investment climate for the energy sector.&nbsp; Key evaluation objectives of the mid-term evaluation included the following: (1) identifying and assessing progress toward achieving each LESSP objective; (2) identifying unexpected implementation obstacles and the program's responses; (3) identifying which aspects of the program worked, which did not, and why; (4) assessing the effectiveness of the program's grant component; (5) analyzing the relationships between resources available, resources used and results achieved to determine the specific cost-effectiveness of USAID's programming in each objective, as well as the program as a whole; and, (6) making specific recommendations for the final two years of the program, including eventual modification of the program.&nbsp; The evaluation team's findings suggest the following: (1) strengthen the government of Liberia's (GOL) capacity to implement plans for rural electrification as expressed in the National Energy Sector Policy; (2) establish commercially viable pilot plants that provide renewable energy services to population centers in Bong, Lofa and Nimba counties; and (3) collaborate with other international donors for the expansion of Monrovia's power distribution network.

PB-AAA-234,"Pakistan's generally low investment in education, and specifically higher education, has severely affected the financial health of Pakistan's universities. &nbsp;In fiscal year (FY) 2007-08, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) cut the Higher Education Commission's (HEC) budget for recurring grants to universities by 21 percent. &nbsp;Also, since FY 2008-09, the GOP has consistently released less money than budgeted for development grants, which support scholarships, infrastructure (e.g., buildings, laboratory equipment) and other development projects, and pay the salaries of development project staff, all of which are crucial to strengthening the ability of Pakistan's universities to meet future needs. &nbsp;In moves that further aggravated the weak financial situation of universities, in FY 2008-09 the GOP mandated 20 percent increases in government employees' salaries (including those of university staff), but did not increase funding levels to cover these increases. &nbsp;In the same year, the GOP waived tuition and fees for 7,354 internally displaced students without increasing funding to the affected universities to cover the lost tuition revenue. &nbsp;USAID responded to the problems posed by these financial cuts to universities by providing two separate cash transfers to HEC. &nbsp;The overall objective of the First Cash Transfer was to expand the availability of university and technical education to students from conflict-affected areas. &nbsp;The transfer was intended to contribute to the ""Investing in People"" objective under the U.S. Foreign Assistance Framework, especially in the areas of higher education and social assistance. &nbsp;The Second Cash Transfer was intended to ""Increase research capacity, improve teaching techniques and laboratory facilities, and enhance the quality and applicability of academic degrees in academic disciplines related to agricultural sciences and hydrology."" It also supported other disciplines which support these sectors including environmental sciences, engineering and economics. &nbsp;The purpose of this evaluation is to determine whether the two cash transfers have achieved expected results. The evaluation should facilitate stakeholder accountability, assess project performance (e.g. effectiveness and relevance), and generate recommendations for improving future cash transfer programs and other programming to support higher education.

PA-00J-R2Q,"The Alternative Resources in Media (ARM) is a $4 million, four-year program now entering the second half of its period of implementation.&nbsp; The program has three objectives: (1) supporting production and dissemination of alternative content through multiple high and low tech platforms; (2) building consumer demand for news and information by promoting media literacy, critical analysis, and use of latest web and mobile-based media applications; and (3) encouraging public advocacy on media-related issues.&nbsp; The broader goal, as stated by USAID, is to assist citizens to transform themselves from passive users to active information producers in an otherwise controlled media environment.&nbsp; The evaluation addresses a set of five questions focused on identifying what changes should be made in the approaches and directions of the current program, and what recommendations can be made for the design of future media programs.&nbsp; The questions, as stated in the evaluation statement of work (SOW) are: (1) how relevant has the ARM project intervention been to the media field challenges in Armenia; (2) to what extent has the project contributed to creating opportunities for&nbsp;a diversity of alternative sources of information and opinion,&nbsp;increased access to alternative sources of information and opinion, and advocacy for improved enabling environment for media independence; (3) what has the project done or mechanisms has it created to ensure that the project products will be sustained; (4) what have been the added value and/or drawbacks of the project management structure (consortium of three local organizations with an unaffiliated Chief of Party); and (5) how successful has the project been in leveraging resources of (a) the skills and organizational strengths of the consortium members, and (b) private and other donor partnerships?&nbsp; In the remaining project period, it is generally recommended that the ARM project look for ways to be more selective in the activities it supports, giving more focus and resources to those that are most relevant and effective.&nbsp; Specifically, it is recommended that ARM: (1) establish additional Infotuns (regional information centers);&nbsp; (2) take initiatives to support the use of new media tools to promote democratic processes and principles in the February 2013 presidential election -- in cooperation with national and international election monitoring groups, ARM should use its experience and knowledge of new media in projects to help inform citizens about issues, candidates, interest groups, and proper election process, and to assist journalists, monitors, and voters to observe and to report and correct irregularities in campaigning, balloting, and vote counting; (3) be even more creative and proactive in efforts to promote media literacy and educate the Armenian public about the new media environment and how to understand and use the new knowledge that it makes available; (4) make additional grants to assist traditional media making the transition to multimedia news coverage; (5) initiate exploratory discussions on the changing media market with media managers (editorial and business), advertisers and ad agencies, rating companies, and other relevant stakeholders to collect data and ideas on how media will have to adapt to the new environment, and develop concepts for future projects to assist in that process.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Evaluated project title: Alternative resources in media (ARM),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-111-TO-12-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00019 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00019-00,,1/1/2013 0:00,,Communications management ~|~_©_~|~ Communication media ~|~_©_~|~ Information dissemination ~|~_©_~|~ High technology ~|~_©_~|~ Information technology ~|~_©_~|~ Demand ~|~_©_~|~ Internet ~|~_©_~|~ Literacy ~|~_©_~|~ Advocacy ~|~_©_~|~ Access to resources,Armenia,AID-111-A-10-00003,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JR2Q.pdf,529 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,"008509 - USAID.

PA-00J-QFV,"The ProJustice Program was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to address challenges faced by the Congolese judiciary while supporting reforms initiated by the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (GoDRC), as set forth in the 2006 constitution. &nbsp;Tetra Tech DPK implemented the ProJustice Program over the course of five years (September 2008&ndash;September 2013) with a budget of US $20,484,410. &nbsp;The main objective of the program was to develop an accessible and empowered justice system through improved judicial management, lower costs of access to justice, and a more informed and engaged public. &nbsp;ProJustice was designed around four main components, each with a corresponding core objective: (1) supporting the establishment of new judicial institutions; (2) more effective and transparent management of the judiciary and Ministry of Justice (MoJ); (3) more effective, transparent, and accessible court operations in pilot jurisdictions; and (4) increasing access to justice for vulnerable populations. &nbsp;This final performance evaluation helps to assess the validity of the program design and assumptions as well as the overall performance of the ProJustice Program, and to gauge the present landscape of the judiciary in the DRC. &nbsp;The specific objectives of this evaluation exercise are to: (1) make an overall independent assessment of the past performance of the ProJustice Program, with particular attention to the impact of program actions against its pre-established goals and objectives; and (2) identify key lessons learned and propose practical recommendations for the program and USAID/DRC for future rule of law (RoL) strategies. &nbsp;The evaluation found that the approach used by the program on both the supply and the demand sides of the justice system appears to have had a positive effect on the Congolese judicial institutions. &nbsp;With the exception of activities conducted under a fifth component, &ldquo;Windows of Opportunity,&rdquo; all four program components have been deemed appropriate, based upon data emerging from the evaluation. &nbsp;Several adjustments have been proposed to better support the justice sector and provide target communities with access to fair and transparent justice. &nbsp;The evaluation exercise and data confirm that the approach taken by the program was relevant and appropriate, addressing the needs and critical issues that the program set out to achieve. &nbsp;Although there were opportunities for improvement, overall the ProJustice project was successful in meeting its objectives. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","Cover title: Final evaluation : ProJustice program in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ~|~_©_~|~ ""USAID Contract Number AID-RAN-I-00-09-00015, Task Order Number AID-660-TO-13-00001""",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-660-TO-13-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00015 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00015-00,,1/1/2014 0:00,,Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Courts ~|~_©_~|~ Judicial reform ~|~_©_~|~ Judiciary ~|~_©_~|~ Litigation ~|~_©_~|~ Magistrates ~|~_©_~|~ Transparency ~|~_©_~|~ Violence against women,Congo DR,263-I-01-06-00019-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 263-I-00-06-00019-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-263-I-01-06-00019 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-263-I-00-06-00019,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JQFV.pdf,1183 KB,"011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

PA-00J-Q88,"The Community Development Program (CDP) represented one of USAID's longest-running stabilization efforts in Afghanistan.&nbsp; The program officially adopted stabilization objectives in September 2010 and shifted focus to primarily rural areas identified by USAID field staff in coordination with International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF).&nbsp; Despite changing program objectives, over its lifespan CDP implemented the same type of infrastructure projects, without relying on subcontractors.&nbsp; The evaluation team considered the following key questions: (1) were projects designed with the appropriate stakeholders, and did they meet the criteria for selection; (2) were community engagement processes effective; (3) were government engagement processes effective; (4) was laborer recruitment appropriately targeted and perceived to be fair; (5) were payment processes perceived to be effective, fair, and transparent; (6) were procurement processes perceived as fair, efficient, and transparent; (7) were training and maintenance plans well designed and effective; (8) how did stakeholders (including the community) perceive the project in terms of attribution and quality of work; (9) were monitoring systems effective; (10) was coordination between USAID and the Central Asian Development Group (CADG) effective, and (11) did the program meet its Performance Management Plan targets?&nbsp; The findings of this evaluation suggest that CDP was quick and flexible, and displayed a remarkable ability to work in some of Afghanistan's most difficult areas. In general, projects facilitated positive interactions between communities and the government and were positively perceived by communities.&nbsp; CDP's success can largely be attributed to its longevity and CADG's strong relationships with USAID, the Afghan government, and communities.&nbsp; By the final phase of the nearly five-year program, CDP systems were well honed.&nbsp; Directly implementing projects rather than relying on subcontractors allowed the program to be more responsive and to have better control over recruitment, implementation, and involvement of the Afghan government.&nbsp; However, CDP was not immune to the pressures of a challenging environment.&nbsp; Corruption was known to be a significant issue and this evaluation's findings indicate that it may have been more widespread than previously documented.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Evaluated project title: Community development program (CDP) ~|~_©_~|~ Task order title: Measuring impact of stabilization initiatives (MISTI),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-306-TO-12-00004 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-10-00002,,2/1/2014 0:00,,Community development ~|~_©_~|~ Stability ~|~_©_~|~ Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Political corruption ~|~_©_~|~ Risk ~|~_©_~|~ Civil-military relations ~|~_©_~|~ Internal conflict,Afghanistan,306-A-00-09-00511-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-306-A-00-09-00511,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JQ88.pdf,596 KB,"003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

PA-00J-Q5B,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">A performance evaluation was conducted of two USAID-funded human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing and counseling (HTC) projects in Tanzania.&nbsp; The first, a project titled ""Rapid Scale up of Innovative HIV Counseling and Testing Approaches on Tanzania Mainland,"" is known locally as Angaza Zaidi, and was implemented by African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF) and partners starting in 2008 with a budget of $16.3 million over five years.&nbsp; The main goal of Angaza Zaidi was to increase the number of Tanzanians who know their HIV status and link those who test positive to care and treatment services.&nbsp; A non-profit affiliate of the Johns Hopkins University, Jhpiego, and partners received $16.5 million USD, also in 2008, to lead the other project, Universal HIV/AIDS Intervention for Counseling and Testing (UHAI-CT) over five years.&nbsp; UHAI-CT's main goal was to increase testing and counseling particularly among high-risk populations.&nbsp; Angaza Zaidi implemented HTC through stand-alone voluntary counseling and testing (VCT), integrated VCT and community outreach, while UHAI-CT implemented HTC through provider-initiated testing and counseling (PITC) and community outreach.&nbsp; The aim of this performance evaluation was to provide USAID/Tanzania, the Government of Tanzania, and other in-country stakeholders with an objective, independent assessment of the efficiency and quality of the performance of these two projects at the national, regional, facility and community-based service levels.&nbsp; To do this, the evaluation team used a cross-sectional design to evaluate the two projects and collected data using a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods in six regions: Iringa, Tabora, Njombe, Tanga, Kilimanjaro, and Dar es Salaam.&nbsp; The evaluation: (1) identifies achievements, implementation gaps and challenges; (2) documents lessons learned and best practices; and (3) provides key recommendations for future programming.&nbsp; The evaluation team concludes that both projects met many, but not all, of their objectives and targets.&nbsp; Although the evaluation documents several weaknesses, both projects had more strengths than weaknesses.&nbsp; While all of the HTC modalities played a significant role in increasing HTC and reaching different populations, they were not used strategically to reach populations at high risk.&nbsp; Among a number of key lessons learned by both projects is the necessity for a decentralized approach to project management in Tanzania to facilitate project monitoring, communication, and stakeholder engagement.&nbsp; Neither project created a robust, traceable linkage system to ensure HIV-positive clients are linked to care and treatment.&nbsp; However, both projects made measurable progress towards building the capacity of local institutions and institutionalizing practices for HTC.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)</p>",Evaluated project title: Rapid scale up of innovative HIV counseling and testing approaches on Tanzania mainland (also known as 'Angaza zaidi') ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Universal HIV and AIDS intervention for counseling and testing (UHAI-CT),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-621-TO-13-00004 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00016-00,,2/1/2014 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Business enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Counseling services ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Health facilities ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion ~|~_©_~|~ Questionnaires,Tanzania,621-A-00-08-00018-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 621-A-00-08-00019-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JQ5B.pdf,1687 KB,"001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

PA-00J-Q4Q,"The USAID Municipal Competitiveness Project (MCP) in El Salvador is a $11.2 million project which was designed to improve the competitiveness of Salvadoran municipalities through the development of a unique model with several inter-related components designed to: (1) enhance municipal effectiveness and efficiency; (2) measure the local business climate; (3) encourage private-public and inter-jurisdictional engagement and dialogue; and (4) provide incentive funds to encourage municipalities to mobilize financial resource for improving economic development and security.&nbsp; The purpose of this final performance evaluation of the MCP is to document the effectiveness of the project from its inception in October 2010 through September 2013 and to inform USAID and other stakeholders of opportunities for additional investments.&nbsp; The primary objectives of the evaluation are to: (1) document successes and shortcomings of the MCP approaches in order to determine their effectiveness in promoting municipal competitiveness and business enabling environments; (2) make recommendations for priority activities to ensure sustainability and increased private sector participation and improve competitiveness at the municipal level; (3) identify the level of success of the Domestic Finance for Development (DF4D) component in promoting Municipal Competitiveness Committee (MCC) participation in community crime prevention activities; (4) make recommendations on MCP approaches to encourage increased municipal revenues; and (5) offer suggestions on measuring municipal level investment in the country.&nbsp; The overall conclusion of this evaluation is that MCP is highly innovative and has made a significant contribution to municipal development in El Salvador.&nbsp; Clearly, developing a business-enabling environment within which local areas develop a culture of competitiveness is a long-term process, and it is a process that will likely require sustained interventions on the part of USAID and other development partners.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the gains described in this report are still tentative in many MCP municipalities, the experiences accrued by the project have a potential to serve as a model for municipal development internationally for those countries that are pursuing municipal or other subnational development strategies that require some degree of decentralization.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)&nbsp;",'Evaluation report' ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Municipal competitiveness project (MCP) = Proyecto para la competitividad ~|~_©_~|~ municipal (PCM) ~|~_©_~|~ Spanish ed.: PA-00J-Q4R,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-519-O-14-00001,,1/1/2014 0:00,,Business enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Crimes ~|~_©_~|~ Investment ~|~_©_~|~ Municipal level ~|~_©_~|~ Private sector ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Revenues ~|~_©_~|~ Violence against women,El Salvador,EPP-I-00-04-00037-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JQ4Q.pdf,1860 KB,"001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

PA-00J-PRV,"The Transition and Persistence Project (TAP) was a three-year USAID-funded education project, implemented by Plan Ghana.&nbsp; The project aimed to increase junior high school (JHS) enrollment and completion rates in 156 JHSs across 13 districts in 4 regions (Brong Ahafo, Central, Eastern, and Greater Accra).&nbsp; TAP contributed to USAID's Strategic Objective 8 (SO8): ""Improved Quality of, and Access to, Basic Education."" &nbsp;The objectives of the TAP project were to: (1) increase the number of improved spaces available for JHS enrollment in targeted districts through building new facilities or rehabilitating existing facilities, (2) increase JHS enrollment in targeted districts by improving teacher quality, strengthening district level Ghana Education Service oversight, providing more diverse and innovative educational opportunities for children, promoting community involvement and ownership of the SIP process; and creating incentives and rewards for teachers, children, and communities for improving performance, (3) increase JHS completion rates by institutionalizing the processes and systems that will be used to increase enrollment.&nbsp; This evaluation was designed to explore the degree to which the desired changes were brought about due to the TAP interventions.&nbsp; The evaluation field work developed a sample based on disaggregating across the schools which exhibited the highest enrollment change and average and lowest enrollment change over the three year TAP intervention period (2010/11 to 2012/13); the evaluation also explored the degree to which interventions were effective and yielded the most promising results for replication. &nbsp;The evaluation study found that the TAP project recorded enormous improvements in increasing the spaces, improving the physical infrastructure and in reducing socio-economic barriers to JHS enrollment and completion for pupils and their families across 156 TAP schools in 13 districts of Ghana.&nbsp; The evaluation revealed that the TAP project was a highly valued intervention by all stakeholder groups interviewed, particularly teachers, communities and children.&nbsp; Evidence from interviews revealed that TAP interventions met the immediate practical needs of households and schools.&nbsp; Key stakeholders at the district and school levels also suggest that the TAP project should continue, with at most minor modifications.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Project title: Transition and persistence (TAP),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,641-A-00-10-00026-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-641-A-00-10-00026,,1/1/2014 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Boys ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Enrollment ~|~_©_~|~ Girls ~|~_©_~|~ Mathematics ~|~_©_~|~ Rural areas ~|~_©_~|~ Students,Ghana,641-A-00-10-00026-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-641-A-00-10-00026,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JPRV.pdf,787 KB,"040824 - Associates For Change (AFC) ~|~_©_~|~ 013207 - Plan International USA, Inc.",,008547 - USAID.

However, in both provinces, SCIP activities experience government of Mozambique (GOM) and donor-related limitations to full integration. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",'Evaluation Report' ~|~_©_~|~ Cover title: USAID/Mozambique strengthening communities through integrated programming performance evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Strengthening communities through integrated programming (SCIP),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-656-TO-13-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00016-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00016,,1/1/2014 0:00,,Integrated health care ~|~_©_~|~ HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural development ~|~_©_~|~ Nutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Water sanitation ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Community health care ~|~_©_~|~ Community services ~|~_©_~|~ Community mobilization ~|~_©_~|~ Youth,Mozambique,656-A-00-09-00134-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-656-A-00-09-00134,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JNNZ.pdf,1368 KB,"001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

PA-00J-MK1,"The Marine Resources Program (MRP) is the marine portfolio of the USAID mission in Indonesia. &nbsp;The program was designed to support the Government of Indonesia (GOI) in its commitment to promote sustainable fisheries, marine conservation and marine protected areas, as reflected in its recognition of the Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI). &nbsp;The five components of MRP are: (1) strengthen Ministry of Marine Affairs and Fisheries (MMAF) through institutional development (ID); (2) improve sustainable fisheries management (SFM); (3) strengthen coastal community resilience and climate change adaptation (CCR); (4) create and effectively manage Marine Protected Areas (MPA); and, (5) improve capacity to reduce Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IUU). &nbsp;These components support the Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI) Indonesian draft National Plan of Action (NPOA), which defines Indonesia's plans to preserve marine biodiversity. &nbsp;The key questions therefore posed during the evaluation were: (1) what has been the effectiveness of the Indonesia Marine and Climate Support project (IMACS) and USAID Marine Protected Area Governance Project (MPAG) projects' activities in achieving planned results in accordance with work plans and performance management plans, including the extent to which projects have produced concrete biodiversity conservation outcomes and activities that comply with USAID's biodiversity earmark criteria; (2) what is the capacity of the IMACS and MPAG project teams to implement activities in an efficient and timely manner, including utilization of grants, subcontracts, and other resources; (3) what were the important policy actions, institutional relationships, and partnering arrangements that facilitated project success; (4) is the MRP achieving satisfactory results against targets in the following component areas: (a) strengthening MMAF through institutional development; (b) improving sustainable fisheries management; (c) strengthening coastal community resilience and climate change adaptation; (d) creating and effectively managing marine protected areas; and (e) improving capacity to reduce illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing; and (5) is the MRP achieving its overall objective of sustaining the long-term welfare of coastal Indonesians by reducing the destruction of marine resources and preparing them for climate change impacts and is the MRP strategy of strengthening the capacity of MMAF and providing targeted technical assistance, producing sustainable improvements to ecosystems and institutions? &nbsp;The evaluation finds that in the three years of operation of the MRP, there have been significant achievements at the project level, as documented in MPAG and IMACS Annual and quarterly reports. &nbsp;Overall, most project activities are either on schedule or ahead of schedule with the MPAG component having achieved more than 70% of its overall planned results up to 2012, when measured against work plans and the MPAG PMP. &nbsp;Likewise, IMACS has achieved over 70% of its planned results as at the end of 2012 with activities such as training being ahead of schedule when measured against performance indicators. &nbsp;The over-arching recommendation for the evaluation is that during the period to 2014, IMACS and MPAG should concentrate on assisting MMAF, at both national and regional level, to develop a clear strategic, integrated action plan to implement its current vision and strategy for sustainable use and conservation of marine biodiversity and fisheries resources. &nbsp;This would provide a firm foundation for any future USAID assistance. &nbsp;Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",Evaluated project title: Marine protected area governance (MPAG) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order title: Indonesia marine and climate support (IMACS),Special Evaluation,Documents,,,3/1/2013 0:00,,Marine resources ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Climate change ~|~_©_~|~ Protected wildlife areas ~|~_©_~|~ Protected area managers ~|~_©_~|~ Natural resource management ~|~_©_~|~ Natural resource conservation,Indonesia,AID-497-LA-12-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-497-TO-11-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-EPP-I-00-06-00013 ~|~_©_~|~ EPP-I-00-06-00013-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JMK1.pdf,1729 KB,,,008558 - USAID.

PA-00J-M2M,"<div>The Opportunities for Vulnerable Children (OVC) program represents a unique and highly commendable effort made by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to bring children with disabilities into Indonesia's mainstream education settings in a substantive manner. &nbsp;The program -- which only cost USD 9.3 million in 10 years or USD 930,000 a year on average -- contributed significantly to strengthening the Indonesian enabling educational environment for children with disabilities, in the following ways: (1) building substantial government bureaucratic and political support for inclusion of children with disabilities; (2) spearheading the development of national policies, such as recognition of ""resource teachers"" as a legitimate category of service, and 22 subnational policies that operationalized the national inclusive education policies; (3) helping stakeholders to lobby for and legitimize the development of budgets to support inclusive education, which will allow inclusive education initiatives to be funded post-OVC; and (4) changing parents' and community attitudes about the rights of children with disabilities to an education. &nbsp;The above was achieved by well-targeted use of short-term technical experts and ongoing engagement of very knowledgeable program personnel who understand how to work with and within the existing systems. &nbsp;However, without strategic and selective external technical support for deepening and broadening OVC accomplishments, full realization of OVC program benefits is at risk. &nbsp;There is also a risk that inclusive education will remain synonymous with special education, rather than special education falling under the umbrella of a functional inclusive education system. &nbsp;USAID's Education Strategy Goal 1 will ensure that 150 million children worldwide become readers in the early grades; however, most early grade reading assessments have not taken children with disabilities into account in testing protocols, data disaggregation, or ensuing programming. &nbsp;If USAID is able to act on the opportunity for disability-sensitive programming that the OVC program introduced, Indonesia can provide a valuable model on which to build in order to bring children with disabilities into this broader group of 150 million children. &nbsp;Failure of the government and donor community to further to deepen and extend OVC program achievements would be a significant and regrettable ""missed opportunity."" &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</div>",Evaluated project title: New opportunities for vulnerable children (N-OVC) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title also known as: Opportunities for vulnerable children (OVC),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-497-TO-13-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00008 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00008-00,,12/1/2013 0:00,,Children ~|~_©_~|~ Education ~|~_©_~|~ Nutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Students ~|~_©_~|~ Teachers,Indonesia,497-A-00-10-00019-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-497-A-00-10-00019,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JM2M.pdf,1882 KB,"040773 - GRM International ~|~_©_~|~ 006007 - AMEX International, Inc.",,"008558 - USAID.

PA-00J-K6H,"The main goal of the USAID/Nicaragua supported Education for Success (EFS) project is to develop and implement an integrated program for at-risk children and youth in targeted municipalities in the Regi&oacute;n Aut&oacute;noma del Atl&aacute;ntico Sur (RAAS) that would provide opportunities for formal and non-formal education, life skills, and workforce competencies. &nbsp;Implemented by Fundacion para la Autonomia y Desarrollo de la Costa Atlantica de Nicaragua (FADCANIC), EFS was launched in 2010 as a seven-year, $6.7 million effort implemented initially in Bluefields, Pearl Lagoon, Kukra Hill and then later in Corn Island and Desembocadura del Rio Grande. &nbsp;In September 2013, USAID/Nicaragua requested that JBS International, Inc. conduct a mid-term evaluation of the EFS project. &nbsp;The purpose of the study was to examine the extent to which the program has contributed to advancing its stated goals. &nbsp;It was also designed to capture the lessons learned to date, help identify changes to be made in the second phase of project implementation, and identify obstacles constraining progress. &nbsp;In October 2013, a team of three researchers conducted a site visit of the EFS project which included numerous key informant interviews, semi-structured group interviews, and on-site observations. &nbsp;The results of the mid-term evaluation demonstrate that EFS has been successful in generating youth development opportunities in the RAAS. &nbsp;More specifically it has contributed to increased positive attitudes such as greater self-confidence in youth; transferable work readiness skills; and more engaged family and community members. &nbsp;As EFS begins its second phase, the evaluation team recommends FADCANIC increase its staff expertise in non-formal education strategies, gender-sensitive programming, and community development approaches. &nbsp;Certain improvements to FADCANIC's organizational, technical and management systems are also suggested in order to strengthen and ready the project's core staff as they move to the next stage. &nbsp;(Except, modified)",Submitted as: Mid-term evaluation final report of the education for success project ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Education for success (EFS),Special Evaluation,Documents,,,12/1/2013 0:00,,Educational development ~|~_©_~|~ At-risk groups ~|~_©_~|~ Youth ~|~_©_~|~ Access to education ~|~_©_~|~ Labor force ~|~_©_~|~ Employment ~|~_©_~|~ Life skills,Nicaragua,AID-524-A-10-00005,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JK6H.pdf,1106 KB,"013070 - JBS International, Inc.

PA-00J-K6G,"The Nicaragua Strategic Alliance for Social Investment in Education and Health (Alliances 2) was funded by USAID/Nicaragua (USAID/N) and implemented by RTI International (RTI) from September 2010 to December 2013. &nbsp;It follows its predecessor, Alliances 1, which was implemented during the period March 2006 to December 2009. &nbsp;Both projects sought to bring together United States Government (USG) and Nicaraguan private sector financial resources, combined with international and local technical expertise, to produce positive results in education, health, and democracy and governance sectors of Nicaragua. &nbsp;This report presents findings from the final evaluation of project carried out during October 2013 conducted by JBS International, Inc. &nbsp;The evaluation sought to learn the extent to which Alliances 2 objectives and goals were achieved, and to inform the design of future projects, particularly those using the public-private partnership approach working in the areas of health, education, and democracy and governance. &nbsp;The principal beneficiaries of the evaluation were intended to be the USAID Mission and civil society, including non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector. &nbsp;USAID/Nicaragua asked the evaluation team to focus on 18 issue areas contained in the scope of work, with three overarching evaluation questions: (1) what objectives/targets were met towards the agreement's highest level results; (2) what are the lessons learned from the program's implementation; and (3) were sub-grants managed and implemented effectively. &nbsp;The evaluation concluded that the project exceeded its goal of establishing 15 partnerships with for-profit entities by establishing relationships with 56 partners as well as surpassing its goal for cash and in-kind counterpart contributions. &nbsp;While Alliances 2 has experienced a few stumbling blocks, it is clear that the alliance approach to supporting the development of education and health sectors has been very successful and it is recommended that it be continued and expanded. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",Submitted as: Alliances 2 project final performance evaluation report ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Nicaragua strategic alliance for social investment in education and health (Alliances 2),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,,,12/1/2013 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Health care costs ~|~_©_~|~ Investment ~|~_©_~|~ Life skills ~|~_©_~|~ Mutual funds ~|~_©_~|~ Rural areas,Nicaragua,520-A-00-10-00031-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JK6G.pdf,963 KB,"013070 - JBS International, Inc.

PA-00J-JZ9,"A midterm evaluation of the Control and Prevention of Three Diseases (CAP-3D) Project was undertaken in Burma, Laos, and Thailand and a final evaluation was undertaken in China in June and July 2013. &nbsp;The overarching strategy for this project is to increase the coverage, quality, and sustainability of a comprehensive package of for HIV prevention, care, and treatment services. &nbsp;A major area of emphasis is reducing dependence on external donor resources by strengthening local institutions and securing local government buy-in and diverse funding sources. &nbsp;To achieve this, PSI and its partners focus on the following objectives: (1) the scale up of the CPP model, shifting increasingly toward provision of technical assistance to local agencies for CPP implementation (IR1); (2) valuation and documentation of CPP models and use of strategic information (SI) to advocate for replication and leveraged funding (IR2); and (3) enabling local organizations to scale-up the CPP through provision of technical assistance and capacity building (IR3). &nbsp;The evaluation focused on answering &nbsp;five key questions: (1) to what extent have the approaches used for prevention, care and treatment for the most vulnerable populations achieved results to date; (2) what progress has been made toward ensuring sustainability of CAP-3D's approaches; (3) to what extent does the way that the CAP-3D project is organized, operates, and maintains relationships and communication with key stakeholders, establish an effective and sustainable approach; (4) looking at the HIV programs from a regional perspective, to what extent will CAP-3D be able to achieve critical results, at scale, in HIV prevention, treatment and care by the end of the project; and (5) to what extent are the strategic information activities serving to inform the planning, implementation and monitoring of the project. &nbsp;The evaluation concluded that overall CAP-3D represents an appropriate regional focus on prevention and HIV testing to ensure continuity and linkages throughout the comprehensive model of prevention, care and treatment. &nbsp;The project is appropriately focused among men-who-have-sex-with-men, transgendered women, and female sex workers. &nbsp;The added activities for people who inject drugs in China were also appropriate and in accordance to the local epidemiology. &nbsp;(Excerpts, modified)",Evaluated project title: Control and prevention of three diseases (CAP-3D),Special Evaluation,Documents,,,10/1/2013 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Tuberculosis ~|~_©_~|~ Malaria ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Health care coverage ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Disease treatment ~|~_©_~|~ Local level ~|~_©_~|~ Men who have sex with men ~|~_©_~|~ Transgendered persons ~|~_©_~|~ Prostitution,Burma ~|~_©_~|~ Laos ~|~_©_~|~ Thailand ~|~_©_~|~ China,AID-486-A-11-00004,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JJZ9.pdf,1335 KB,,,011460 - USAID.

PB-AAA-337,"The Lira Child Survival Project educated health workers and caregivers about early childhood development and simple actions they can take daily to support their infants was integrated as a key strategy. &nbsp;The project was implemented by Medical Teams International and the Lira District Health Office served a population of 124,379 and operated in Lira, Aromo and Ogur sub-counties of Lira District in Northern Uganda. &nbsp;The project used a two-pronged approach to improve the health and nutrition status of women and children under age five: (1) promoting behavior change and community mobilization to take appropriate responsibility for health; and (2)) building District Health Office (DHO) capacity to provide sustainable, quality service delivery at the facility and community levels. &nbsp;Educating health workers and caregivers about early childhood development (ECD) and simple actions they can take daily to support their infants was integrated as a key strategy. &nbsp;Quantitative data collected during the final survey showed a remarkable increase in key ECD indicators. &nbsp;After training in early childhood development, the percentage of mothers who played games which provided cognitive stimulation increased from 38% at baseline to 76% at final. &nbsp;The percentage of mothers who told a story, sang a song, or named objects for their child to encourage linguistic learning increased from 23% to 78% and the percentage of mothers who helped their child walk, massaged them, or played a game to challenge physical development increased from 63% to 84%. &nbsp;Also, integrating early childhood development with child survival interventions in Lira District led to improvements in parent-child relationships and has encouraged caregivers to spend greater and more meaningful time with children reading, singing, and playing games that encourage physical, cognitive and language development. &nbsp;Community members also report it has facilitated better relationships between spouses by helping parents better understand and interact with their children, which seems to be a contributing factor to reducing household violence. &nbsp;(Excerpts, modified)","'Educating community health workers, caregivers, and health providers regarding maternal child health and early childhood development in a post-conflict environment' ~|~_©_~|~ USAID cooperative agreement no. also listed in document as GHS-A-00-09-00012 ~|~_©_~|~ Submitted as: Final evaluation report : Lira child survival project ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Child survival and health grants program (CSHGP) ~|~_©_~|~ Mid-term evaluation: PD-ACT-420",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,GSH-A-00-09-00012-00,,12/1/2013 0:00,,Case management ~|~_©_~|~ Child health care ~|~_©_~|~ Child malnutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Dance ~|~_©_~|~ Health care costs ~|~_©_~|~ Infant nutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Mothers,Uganda,GSH-A-00-09-00012-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PBAAA337.pdf,4304 KB,012966 - Medical Teams International (MTI),,,English,application/pdf,,,"Sue Leonard ~|~_©_~|~ Carruth, Mary Helen ~|~_©_~|~ et al.",Child survival,1-Dec-13,,,,Final evaluation report : Lira District child survival project in Uganda,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTgxMjQz,Uganda,,,2013-12-01,2013,UGA,UGA_2013,0.40459464727042793,0.330139770999565,0.7189132706374091,0.605665365421615,,0.444444444444444,0.442650903717176,0.189179889047217,0.40162781290147404,,0.31555051078320095,,,0.41198701601672605,0.7095521615324879,0.203703703703704,,UGA,2013,2.0,0.49596142589043507,3.0,0.38545748100332444,TZA_2016,MOZ_2017,NGA_2015,NGA_2013,MLI_2016

PA-00J-JSF,"In August, 2013 the Promoting Long-Term Sustainability of Parque Nacional Cordillera Azul project finishes its operations after 5 years of implementation, including its original period and two extensions1 under an award from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID.) In this period, the award adds up to almost $5 million in support to the project. USAID/Peru has commissioned this evaluation to assess the effectiveness of the Parque Nacional Cordillera Azul (PNCAZ) project in achieving its objectives over the last 5 years. USAID/Peru is also interested in learning from the process and identifying factors that may have contributed to the project&rsquo;s success or failure. Thus, the evaluation responds to three main objectives: (1) to document the implementation process; (2) to learn to what extend the project&rsquo;s expected results have been achieved; and (3) to identify lessons learned from this experience that may be applicable to similar parks or projects. The evaluation's statement of work (SOW) established three evaluation questions that guide the analysis presented in this report: (1) was the Parque Nacional Cordillera Azul effectively protected; (2) has the project contributed to the long-term sustainability of the Park and its management; and (3) what are the key elements of this project that can be replicated in future initiatives to preserve biodiversity and avoid CO2 emissions.

PA-00J-JRR,"The USAID AFFORD Project is funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development and began as a five-year (2005-2010) health marketing initiative led by John Hopkins University Center for Communications in partnership with other organizations. &nbsp;In 2010, USAID/Uganda awarded a three year $18.5 million follow-on Assistance agreement (AFFORD) and an additional one year extension (2011-2014), to Johns Hopkins University (JHU). &nbsp;This second phase has been led by Johns Hopkins University Center for Communications Programs (JHUCCP) in partnership with Uganda Health Marketing Group (UHMG) with a mission to integrate health communication and social marketing techniques to address a variety of health issues and behaviors in Uganda, and an overarching aim of strengthening the institution of UHMG from an organization primarily dependent upon USAID funding to a private sector institution that is self-financing, self-governing and meeting its goal of contributing to the improved health status of Ugandans through Social Marketing. &nbsp;AFFORD objectives have been to: (1) further develop UHMG systems and capacity to support technical, financial, institutional and market sustainability; (2) increase accessibility and affordability of HIV/AIDS, Reproductive Health, Child Survival and malaria products and services for Ugandans using innovative private sector approaches; (3) increase knowledge and promote healthy behaviors and lifestyles among the general population and among targeted hard-to-reach and high-risk population segments. &nbsp;The primary purpose of this evaluation was to determine the extent to which UHMG's capacity as an indigenous organization promoting social marketing has been built and how it has played a key role in improving the uptake of healthy behaviors and increasing demand for delivery of health and HIV/AIDS services in Uganda. &nbsp;The evaluation was designed to inform ongoing and future social marketing activities by UHMG and other social marketing organizations in Uganda. &nbsp;The evaluation report is intended to provide ""lessons learned"" on strengthening local capacity as presented under the 2010 USAID Forward reforms. &nbsp;Questions the evaluation addresses are: (1) did AFFORD increase accessibility and affordability of HIV/AIDS, Reproductive Health, Child Survival and malaria products and services for Ugandans; (2) how relevant and effective have AFFORD's social marketing campaigns been in increasing awareness and uptake of health services; (3) what specifically is AFFORD's contribution to the delivery of health and HIV/AIDS services in Uganda; and (4) to what extent did AFFORD strengthen UHMG systems and capacity for technical, financial, institutional and market sustainability. &nbsp;(Excpert, modified)",Cover title: Performance evaluation of USAID/Uganda AFFORD : health marketing initiative project evaluation : improving the lives of Ugandans ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: AFFORD II ~|~_©_~|~ Mid-term evaluation: PD-ACR-190,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,,,9/1/2013 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Condoms ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Family health care ~|~_©_~|~ Family planning behavior ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Social marketing ~|~_©_~|~ Youth,Uganda,617-A-00-05-00011-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JJRR.pdf,1373 KB,,,008618 - USAID.

PB-AAA-333,"This final performance evaluation of the Integrated Protected Areas Co-management (IPAC) Project focuses exclusively on the democracy and governance (DG) components of the project and assesses the effectiveness of these components in achieving the project's objectives. &nbsp;The evaluation is structured around ten evaluation questions and six DG project indicators relating to the enabling policy and legal framework; community participation and local organizations; capacity building; and communication and outreach. &nbsp;Additional evaluation questions addressed cross-cutting themes of gender and youth engagement; project coordination with stakeholders; project contributions to environmental governance; best practices; sustainable interventions; and project management. &nbsp;Data collection involved a review of project documents and supporting literature, semi-structured interviews with a wide range of stakeholders (from beneficiaries to Ministry staff), and visits to eight of the 25 protected areas in three of the project&lsquo;s five geographic clusters. &nbsp;Political disturbances made field work difficult to schedule, and it was not possible to interview all key stakeholders or make all planned field site visits. &nbsp;Overall, the evaluation concludes that IPAC has been a well-managed project that has done some high quality and well-documented work, met most of its DG targets, and contributed to its overall objectives in a very challenging context. &nbsp;IPAC can be particularly credited with what one observer called an ""unprecedented level of coordination"" with the three departments, helping them break out of their management silos and work together on biodiversity conservation issues. &nbsp;A national strategy and action plan for the PA system was developed and approved by the three departments. &nbsp;Many elements of the legal framework needed for PACM are now in place or in well-advanced preparation. &nbsp;Many stakeholders at all levels have received training on a variety of relevant topics. &nbsp;The co-managed PA system has now reached 25 sites involving 55 co-management organizations (CMOs) and nearly 1,000 participating village groups. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","Footer title: Final performance evaluation of the integrated protected areas co-management (IPAC) project ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order title: Integrated protected areas co-management (IPAC) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Prosperity, livelihoods and conserving ecosystems indefinite quantity contract (PLACE IQC) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Democracy and governance analytical services III",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-388-TO-12-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-10-00003,,9/1/2013 0:00,,Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Democracy ~|~_©_~|~ Protected area managers ~|~_©_~|~ Integrated management ~|~_©_~|~ Aquatic resource management ~|~_©_~|~ Biological diversity ~|~_©_~|~ Local level ~|~_©_~|~ Natural resource conservation,Bangladesh,EPP-I-01-06-00007-00 ~|~_©_~|~ EPP-I-00-06-00007-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PBAAA333.pdf,1253 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,"008511 - USAID.

PB-AAA-133,"The purpose of the evaluation was to assess the Carter Center (TCC) project in Liberia, Access to Justice (ATJ) and Access to Information (ATI), from 2010 to mid-2013, and to capture lessons for potential future USAID programming. &nbsp;ATJ and ATI are two distinct projects under one USAID agreement. &nbsp;ATJ has roots back to 2006 in the customary justice sector, and absorbs 90% of the $6.75 million budget; while ATI is an early-stage project which supports implementation of the Freedom of Information (FOI) Act (passed in 2010), in partnership with ""pilot"" public sector institutions led by the Ministry of Information. &nbsp;The study took place between April 22 and May 31, 2013, and included field visits to Grand Bassa, Bong, and Montserrado counties in Liberia; and a meeting with staff of Carter Center headquarters in Atlanta. &nbsp;Sixty-five persons were interviewed individually or in groups, including public officials, traditional leaders, civil society, and TCC officers and field staff delivering paralegal or information services. &nbsp;A common finding to both ATJ and ATI is the high regard and respect held by respondents for the Carter Center for its exceptional personnel, its skill in working in the justice sector, and its talent playing the role of honest broker. &nbsp;This observation applies both to the highest levels of government and to citizens in rural communities. &nbsp;Despite its position in the hierarchy of aid as a service-delivery NGO, TCC is often - at least as regards customary justice - a strategic leader in Liberia's post- conflict recovery and development. &nbsp;In part, this is due to its long history of commitment to Liberia: President Carter visited in 1979, and programs have been ongoing since 1996. &nbsp;Despite sometimes having little money to bring to the table, it has been an able policy advocate which its high reputation helps reinforce. &nbsp;Finally, common to the two projects are the flaws in the Results Frameworks, which do not follow standard USAID terminology, do not always inform as to project results, and are sometimes confusing. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","'Strengthening Citizen Participation in Government: Access to Justice and Information' ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Access to justice (ATJ) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Access to information (ATI), ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Liberia monitoring and evaluation program (L-MEP)",Special Evaluation,Documents,669-C-00-10-00181-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-669-C-00-10-00181,,6/1/2013 0:00,,Access to justice ~|~_©_~|~ Access to information ~|~_©_~|~ Rule of law ~|~_©_~|~ Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Judicial reform ~|~_©_~|~ Information dissemination ~|~_©_~|~ Legal aid ~|~_©_~|~ Gender equality ~|~_©_~|~ Women ~|~_©_~|~ Community development,Liberia,669-A-00-10-00045-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PBAAA133.pdf,438 KB,"008360 - The Mitchell Group, Inc.

(4) what were the key challenges to the project?; and (5) what are the prospects for sustainability of the end results produced and how effective was the program in building the capacity of Nepali organizations. &nbsp;The evaluation study shows that the EIG program approach was innovative; it linked basic literacy with life skills and agricultural entrepreneurship and productivity leading to employment and income generation. &nbsp;Vocational training program was unique as it entailed training providers to find employment for trainees unlike other general trainings. &nbsp;Furthermore EIG program leveraged resources (about $1.4 million) for infrastructure and capacity building activities. &nbsp;The program was integrated; it initially provided basic literacy and numeracy skills to disadvantaged farmers, arranged services and resources to increase agricultural productivity and promoted marketing of products for income generation. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",SOL-367-12-000010 ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Education for income generation (EIG),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,,,11/1/2013 0:00,,Agricultural occupations ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural production ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural technology ~|~_©_~|~ Business enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Income ~|~_©_~|~ Literacy ~|~_©_~|~ Youth,Nepal,367-C-00-08-00013-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-367-C-00-08-00013,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PBAAA002.pdf,1042 KB,"040720 - Population, Health and Development Group (PHDG)",,008583 - USAID.

PD-ACY-476,"In 2009, recognizing the need to strengthen sub-national governance and its institutions, primarily the Provincial Governors (PGs) and the Provincial Governors' Offices (PGOs), USAID/Afghanistan's Office of Democracy and Governance (ODG) designed the Performance Based Governance Fund (PBGF) project.&nbsp; The purpose of PBGF is to deliver capacity building and financial support to PGs and their offices to enable them to fulfill their key functions as the provincial representatives of the national government and to provide essential services to their respective constituents.&nbsp; The implementing partner for PBGF is The Asia Foundation (TAF).&nbsp; The PBGF project has been implemented in two phases.&nbsp; Phase I (PBGF-I) was co-funded from 2009 - 2011 by USAID, the United Kingdom's Department of International Development (DFID), and the Government of Belgium.&nbsp; Phase II (PBGF-II) was funded solely by USAID and is scheduled to end in 2013.&nbsp; The purpose of this evaluation was to assess the performance of PBGF and TAF in building the capacity of the PGOs to plan, budget, and procure goods and services to respond to the needs of citizens.&nbsp; The evaluation was also called upon to assess the project's capacity to improve the legitimacy and popular perception of the PGOs by examining the quality of interventions and support to different actors in the provincial governance framework.&nbsp; As a final evaluation, the purpose is also to identify lessons that can inform future USAID support to PGOs through similar programs.&nbsp; The evaluation found, despite functioning in areas of the country that are increasingly difficult to monitor and manage, that TAF implemented a well-managed and responsive program that made progress toward its stated goals.&nbsp; The majority of responses received from PGs, PGO staff, line ministries, and beneficiaries regarding PBGF were positive with respect to program management and the financial assistance provided, and the program provided an important benefit to communities by funding grants to community groups identified by PGOs.&nbsp; The evaluation concludes that: (1) that overall, PBGF demonstrated that it is possible to support and build the institutional capacity of PGOs by providing resources, training and mentoring to help them improve and fulfill their outreach and responsiveness to citizens' needs; (2) changes that PBGF introduced in the allocation of spending did appear to have led to improved outreach to outlying districts; (3) a key strength of the program was the reliability with which funds were delivered to PGOs each month, coupled with the incentives PBGF introduced; (4) the incentive system could have been improved by inviting PGOs to participate in its design and provide inputs on various aspects; and (5) capacity building in financial management was an area of the project with little success.&nbsp; Recommendations include: (1) greater attention must be given to developing a Provincial Development Plan that is within the budget capacities of GIRoA; (2) PGOs should be more aware of the various central line ministry funding ceilings before planning development activities; (3) it is recommended that PBGF and PGOs, given the importance of having a visible presence in outlying districts to citizens' perceptions of the PGO and GIRoA, establish a dedicated fund to provide development assistance and services to outlying districts; (4) the design of future projects would also benefit from measuring how much outreach is occurring within each outreach category, who the beneficiaries are, how often outreach is occurring, the costs of outreach activities, the number of districts receiving outreach, and the number of people benefiting on a monthly basis; and (5) building on the positive experiences reported by DoWA representatives and the importance of PBGF funding to DoWA programs, it is recommended that a District Women's Initiative Support program be promoted through the PGOs.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Evaluated project title: Performance-based governance fund project (PBGF ) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Services under program and project offices for results tracking II (SUPPORT II),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-306-C-12-00012,,9/1/2013 0:00,,Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Provinces ~|~_©_~|~ Representative democracy ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Budgeting ~|~_©_~|~ Procurement ~|~_©_~|~ Civil service ~|~_©_~|~ Financial resources ~|~_©_~|~ Regulations,Afghanistan,306-A-00-09-00531-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-306-A-00-09-00531,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACY476.pdf,1663 KB,"000356 - Checchi and Co.

PD-ACY-458,"This is a report on the mid-term performance evaluation of the Judicial Independence and Legal Empowerment Project (JILEP) funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Mission in Georgia. &nbsp;JILEP is being implemented during the period September 24, 2010-September 24, 2014, by the East-West Management Institute (EWMI). &nbsp;JILEP was designed to support and strengthen the judiciary as an independent yet equal branch of government, and to improve Georgia's commercial law system. &nbsp;The main objectives of the evaluation were to determine the effectiveness of JILEP and to provide recommendations on corrective actions and new directions for the remaining years of project implementation and beyond. &nbsp;The main thrust of the evaluation included analyzing JILEP activities from the project's start in September 2010 through the initiation of this evaluation in June 2013 to review progress toward achieving key expected results, as well as identify accomplishments, delays, challenges, and their impact on the project. &nbsp;An integral part of the evaluation mission was to answer a set of pre-determined questions, which focused primarily on judicial reform, building a civil society coalition, legal education, and commercial law. &nbsp;These questions are depicted in the body of this report, followed by sections related to findings, conclusions and recommendations. &nbsp;They concern: (1) the interplay between direct support for the judicial system and support for civil society organizations (CSOs) intent on advocating fundamental changes within the judicial system; (2) the project's effect on judicial reform despite support from the judicial leadership; (3) the project's approach to building a coalition of like-minded non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to support judicial reform; (4) the extent to which the project's approach to legal education was effective; and (5) the extent to which the project's approach to commercial law was effective. &nbsp;The evaluation concludes that: (1) JILEP's design allowed it to allocate resources based on the political will or willingness of its target partners; (2) JILEP's activities effectively contributed to judicial independence, transparency and professionalism; (3) JILEP has been effective in designing and implementing activities that contribute to improved legal education in Georgia and its enhancement of clinical education to hone students' skills is a major breakthrough in Georgia's legal education system; (4) JILEP's activities have had a modest impact on the High School of Justice's ability to provide commercial law training to judges; and (5) due to JILEP's various activities, alternative dispute resolution (ADR) has gained wider acceptance in both mediation and arbitration and commercial adjudication is perceived as less fair by attorneys than it was a year ago. &nbsp;Recommendations include: (1) support for civil society and core legal institutions together in one project is an effective lever for reform; (2) JILEP should continue to work directly with the High Council of Justice, the High School of Justice (HSOJ) and the Ministry of Justice in the same technical areas it has pursued since inception, with a greater focus on those that have not been completed; (3) JILEP should expand its work focusing on the empowerment of judges by assisting the Conference of Judges and the newly-created Unity of Judges; (4) JILEP should continue to work through Coalition for an Independent and Transparent Judiciary as the two-prong approach in pursuing judicial reforms has been successful; (5) JILEP should develop a sustainability strategy for the legal education component to ensure that the initiatives it started continue beyond project completion; (6) JILEP can focus its efforts on commercial law with the HSOJ, which has been generally receptive to commercial law training. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",'Submitted to: USAID/Caucasus' ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Judicial independence and legal empowerment project (JILEP),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-114-TO-13-0003 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-114-I-13-00001,,9/1/2013 0:00,,Judicial reform ~|~_©_~|~ Legal systems ~|~_©_~|~ Empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Human rights ~|~_©_~|~ Rule of law ~|~_©_~|~ Commercial law ~|~_©_~|~ Political leadership ~|~_©_~|~ Transparency,Georgia,AID-114-A-10-00008,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACY458.pdf,521 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates,,009620 - USAID.

PD-ACU-987,"<div>In November-December 2012 a final performance evaluation of the Ulaanbaatar School Buildings Thermo-technical Retrofitting Project was conducted for USAID/Mongolia. &nbsp;The overall goal of the project was to demonstrate the heat energy savings that could be achieved through thermal insulation and heating system improvements at three school buildings. &nbsp;The purpose of the evaluation was to determine the extent to which the project achieved its energy, greenhouse gas (GHG), and learning objectives, and to develop recommendations for the project and for future programming of a similar type. &nbsp;The thermal-technical retrofits to School Nos. 79-1, 79-2, and 63 have transformed exceedingly cold, drafty, and leaky buildings into warm and comfortable environments conducive to learning. &nbsp;The resulting comfort levels in the school buildings have exceeded the expectations of the school staff and students, as well as some project engineers and contractors. &nbsp;School staff and students are pleased with the new environment, more proud of their schools, and expect learning to improve as a result of the retrofits. &nbsp;Two unplanned benefits of this project are that the teachers and some parents at School No. 63 were so enthusiastic about the reincarnation of the building that they repainted the interior of the facility themselves, and people who live near School No. 63 are using the building as a type of informal community center for sports and other activities during non-school hours. &nbsp;Overall, the evaluation team found that the quality of workmanship in both the construction plans and the construction was high, that building envelop improvements were consistent with the plans, and that high quality materials were used. &nbsp;Project partner architects, engineers, and contractors, as well as school directors, noted the unusually thorough and effective construction site supervision and project management, which ensured that construction procedures adhered. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</div>",,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-438-O-13-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-C-11-00154,,1/1/2013 0:00,,School buildings ~|~_©_~|~ Climate change ~|~_©_~|~ Energy efficiency ~|~_©_~|~ Greenhouse gases (GHG) ~|~_©_~|~ Coal ~|~_©_~|~ Cost control ~|~_©_~|~ Knowledge ~|~_©_~|~ Renewable energy resources ~|~_©_~|~ Building renovation ~|~_©_~|~ Thermal processes,Mongolia,438-OUGA-12-001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU987.pdf,977 KB,,,008578 - USAID.

PD-ACU-950,"In 2009, the Targeted States High Impact Project (TSHIP), the USAID/Nigerias flagship project, started improving the quality and delivery of a number of integrated high impact maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH), family planning (FP), and reproductive health (RH) interventions in two States, Bauchi and Sokoto in Nigeria.&nbsp; The TSHIP, along with other USG projects, is part of USAID/Nigerias focus state strategy designed to achieve impact at the state level.&nbsp; The TSHIP design was based of the achievements of prior USG projects, and on a number of assumptions, to achieve the following four strategic subobjectives as measured by 25 indicators: (1) strengthen State and local capacity to deliver and promote high-impact interventions; (2) strengthen service delivery at primary health centers (PHC) and referral levels; (3) strengthen the roles of households and communities; and (4) improve policies, programming and resource allocation.&nbsp; Some of the evaluation findings include: (1) TSHIP has effectively introduced a number of high impact MNCH/FP/RH interventions, trained large numbers of health providers in both States and advocated for a number of system strengthening activities; (2) TSHIP has achieved high levels of visibility and good will among all beneficiaries, raised the level of awareness about quality of care, coverage and community engagement, and created and strengthened an effective community platform, the Ward Development Committees (WDC), to expand the community-based delivery of the target interventions; (3) project progress indicators show that in spite of these achievements, the project has not progressed as planned due to various factors; (4) the state-wide focus and the five TSHIP strategies used to guide project implementation so far have helped the project face the challenges of improving health services at the same scale as the focus states; (5) TSHIP's five overarching strategies do not seem to have followed the approach described in the grant application and the TSHIP Team has not yet taken ""the next step"" to ensure the stakeholders use interventions and incorporate them in their routines; (6) project activities seem to have had much breadth, but not enough depth to effect and sustain change; (7) integrating MNCH/FP health services was the main goal of the TSHIP, but it is not evident; (8) the critical assumption that the essential medicines and supplies would be there for the target interventions to be implemented was not valid; (9) TSHIP's achievements are appreciated by state, LGA and WDC authorities, but are not owned by them; and (10) the grants component has been delayed and is two years behind.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Cover title: Target states high impact project : mid-term evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Target states high impact project (TSHIP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Monitoring and evaluation management services II (MEMS II) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title also known as: Nigeria monitoring and evaluation management services II (NMEMS II),Special Evaluation,Documents,620-M-00-11-00001-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-620-M-00-11-00001,,11/1/2012 0:00,,Demographic surveys ~|~_©_~|~ Diseases ~|~_©_~|~ Health ~|~_©_~|~ Management ~|~_©_~|~ Mass media ~|~_©_~|~ Social conditions,Nigeria,620-A-00-09-00014-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-620-A-00-09-00014,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU950.pdf,1342 KB,"008360 - The Mitchell Group, Inc.

PD-ACU-906,"This evaluation is intended to provide USAID/Bangladesh an informed assessment of the Mission's Improving Local Level Governance (ILLG) project, which included three phases rolled out from 2002 to 2011, at a cost of $3.8 million.&nbsp; In addition to the project's traditional components, ILLG offered several unique components for study.&nbsp; In a break from the usual USAID project structure, in which an intermediary&mdash;most often, U.S.-based contractor or cooperating agency operates between USAID and in-country implementers, Rupantar, a Bangaldeshi nongovernmental organization, worked directly with USAID.&nbsp; As the implementing partner, Rupantar employed a mix of traditional song and drama to provide ""adult civic education"" in addition to more conventional approaches to promoting rural, local democratic governance.&nbsp; The project began in August 2002 with 23 union parishads (UPs), expanding in 2006 to a second phase with 50 UPs, and finally, encompassing 210 UPs and four pourashavas in its third and last phase in 2008, which introduced a disaster management component and lasted until March 2011.&nbsp; The project's three-part strategy worked with three groups: (1) UP chairs and members through training, mentoring and activity support; (2) carefully selected citizen committees through training and mentoring; and (3) citizens through traditional dramatic arts.&nbsp; The evaluation methodology comprised three basic elements: document review, intensive interviews and daylong field visits to 12 UPs in two regions of Bangladesh.&nbsp; The major constraints on the evaluation were the nine-year life of ILLG, and the 18-month lag between its project's end and the evaluation period.&nbsp; Problems included:&nbsp; (1) the evaluation team could not locate USAID personnel who had worked with the project before its terminal year; and (2) the project's target population at little memory of the project.&nbsp; Also, the May 2011 UP elections installed new chairmen in most UPs, along with many new members resulting in a loss of actual ILLG participants available at project locales.&nbsp; These constraints however, did, provide an opportunity to assess post-project sustainability.

PD-ACU-715,"<span style=""font-family: Arial;"">USAID launched the Food, Agriculture and Rural Markets (FARM) project in mid-February, 2010. &nbsp;The project was designed to deliver rapid economic benefits to smallholder farmers by increasing production, improving access to markets as surpluses increased and improving the capacities of the private and public sectors to support market-led agriculture. &nbsp;The project works directly and intensively with farmer-based organizations (FBOs) to disseminate inputs, knowledge and services aimed at increasing production. &nbsp;It concurrently works to link farmers to traders and teach both groupsthe business skills necessary to operate effectively. &nbsp;Finally, through training and support for developing agricultural policy, it builds public- and private-sector capacities to support market-led agricultural growth.USAID commissioned the mid-term performance evaluation of the FARM Project to assess its current performance and to make programmatic recommendations for improving performance in the remaining years of the project. &nbsp;Specifically, the evaluation addressed seven questions focused broadly on: (1) the extent to which the project had achieved targets; (2) cost-efficiency; (3) contribution to USAID intermediate results; and (4) prospects for sustainability, and (5) sensitivity. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</span>","Evaluated project title: Food, agriculture, and rural markets (FARM) ~|~_©_~|~ Related document: PN-AED-045",Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-668-TO-12-00007 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00019-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00019,,12/1/2012 0:00,,Market development ~|~_©_~|~ Rural areas ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural markets ~|~_©_~|~ Food marketing ~|~_©_~|~ Food production ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural development,South Sudan,EDH-I-00-05-00005-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU715.pdf,2887 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,"013413 - USAID.

PD-ACU-705,"<span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"">The Bangladesh Smiling Sun Franchise Program (BSSFP) is a United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/Bangladesh funded health care delivery program providing a package of essential health services through a network of local non-governmental organizations (NGOs). &nbsp;It is a continuation of the NGO Service Delivery Program (NSDP), which had been in place in various forms since the late 1990s. &nbsp;BSSFP operated in areas that had been identified by the Government of Bangladesh (GOB) to have inadequate public health service delivery systems here the government sought assistance from partners to fill the service gap (henceforth referred to as project areas). &nbsp;USAID committed US$46 million for BSSFP over a four-year period (2007-2011). &nbsp;The program was later extended for another year with additional funding of around US$11 million. &nbsp;The programs overall objectives were to increase the use of family planning, maternal, child, and other basic health services in areas served by BSSFP, with an emphasis on serving the poor and on improving the sustainability of local NGOs in continuing to provide these services. &nbsp;The program was developed at a time when funding for USAID/Bangladesh was expected to decline drastically. &nbsp;Thus, improving financial sustainability of local NGOs within a four-year period was a major emphasis of the program. &nbsp;This evaluation report assesses the impact of the BSSFP on increasing use of selected Family Planning, Maternal and Child Health (FP-MCH) services. &nbsp;The results are based on the comparative analysis of a baseline survey conducted in 2008, soon after the programs initiation, and an endline survey conducted in 2011. &nbsp;The survey results reveal that the coverage rate of the three indicators considered increased in rural BSSFP project areas between 2008 and 2011 to the same extent that was observed in comparison areas where the public sector is the primary provider of services. &nbsp;Modern contraception use increased from 50 to 52 percent (49 to 52 percent in comparison areas), ANC use from any provider increased from 52 to 57 percent (50 to 56 percent in comparison areas) and childhood vaccination of DPT-3/Penta-3 coverage increased from 89 to 95 percent (from 89 to 96 percent in comparison areas). &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</span>",Cover title: Bangladesh smiling sun franchise program impact evaluation report ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Bangladesh smiling sun franchise program (BSSFP) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title also known as: Smiling sun franchise program (SSFP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: MEASURE evaluation,Special Evaluation,Documents,GPO-A-00-08-00003-00,,12/1/2012 0:00,,Public health care ~|~_©_~|~ Health delivery ~|~_©_~|~ Family planning ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Poor ~|~_©_~|~ Health finance ~|~_©_~|~ Maternal child health care ~|~_©_~|~ Child welfare,Bangladesh,388-C-00-07-00110-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-388-C-00-07-00110,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU705.pdf,5033 KB,000821 - University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

PD-ACU-559,"<p>The Arid and Marginal Lands Recovery Consortium (ARC) Program in Kenya was a three-year program that ran from 2009-2012, in response to the drought of 2008/9 and the resulting food crisis in Kenya.&nbsp; The goal of the project was to sustain access to food in vulnerable rural communities through enhanced resilience to shocks.&nbsp; The specific objectives of the program were to increase agricultural productivity, to protect and diversify household (HH) asset bases, and to strengthen livelihood options to increase HH purchasing power.&nbsp; The evaluators found that the program beneficiaries across the ARC project area repeatedly expressed confidence that ARC area HHs had improved their ability to cope in times of severe stress as compared to 2009.&nbsp; More specifically, the evaluation outlines the results to five questions: (1) appropriateness of the program; (2) program performance; (3) effectiveness; (4) gender equity; and (5) sustainability.&nbsp; The ARC program has generated important lessons: (1) strengthening of public (Government of Kenya)/private partnerships is an essential component for ensuring the sustainability of activities; (2) community involvement and partnerships are vital to the success of activities, such as community monitoring of livestock border movements and disease control through the Community Disease Control Committees (CDCCs); and (3) economic recovery and income generation activities such as the agro-vet store in Balambala and the tilapia farm in Kinnia proved to be the most attractive and sustainable among pastoralists and drop-outs.&nbsp; Overall recommendations call for the modification of pilot projects and incorporating lessons learned in order to ensure that future activities are scalable and replicable, both technically and financially: (1) build on program successes and achievements by further developing scalable activities from pilot interventions in livestock and alternative livelihoods into larger scale interventions across the target areas; (2) continue the development of alternative livelihoods as options for pastoralists to allow for asset diversification to help strengthen HH resiliency from future shocks; (3) continue the development of growth centers to provide alternative lifestyles and income generating options; and (4) allow time for interventions to produce results of critical mass in order to ensure the realization of impacts from these interventions.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)</p>","""Submitted to: USAID Kenya"" ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Arid and marginal lands recovery consortium (ARC)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-623-TO-11-00007 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00015 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00015-00,,10/1/2012 0:00,,Agriculture ~|~_©_~|~ Diseases ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Economics ~|~_©_~|~ Finance ~|~_©_~|~ Management ~|~_©_~|~ Nutrition,Kenya,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU559.pdf,775 KB,"011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

PD-ACU-555,"<span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"">The Government of El Salvador (GOES) is determined to reverse the current trends of receding or marginal economic growth. &nbsp;To this end, US Government assistance to El Salvador recognizes this GOES-driven process and is supporting measures to overcome the pervasive barriers to increased investment and broad-based economic growth. &nbsp;Moreover, in timely consonance with national efforts to promote economic growth, the Partnership for Growth (PFG) Joint Country Action Plan (JCAP) 2011-2015 between El Salvador and the United States enables the Governments of El Salvador and the United States to jointly engage new efforts to ensure, among other things, that education of the labor force matches labor market demand. &nbsp;Consistent with a focus on workforce development that stems from valuable research conducted prior to the JCAP initiative, in December 2009 USAID awarded a contract to Carana Corporation to undertake the Improving Access to Employment Program in El Salvador (the program), contract EEM-I-00-07-00006-00, with a total funding of $7.4 million. &nbsp;The program, currently in its third year of implementation and scheduled to end in November 2013, focuses on improving the function of the Salvadoran labor market to make it capable of matching the supply of skilled workers with private sector demand for labor.Overall, Program outcomes relate to coverage and engagement of individual beneficiaries, including at-risk youth and people with disabilities, in an effort to increase access to employment. &nbsp;By mid-year 2012, the program had achieved a total of 4,886 new or improved jobs (4,629 new jobs, or 95% of the total, and 257 improved jobs, or 5%). &nbsp;Based on accruals from early 2010, Carana has already surpassed the original life of program (LOP) target of 4,480 by 9%. &nbsp;So far, 42% of persons benefiting from new or improved jobs are women, 21% are youths, and 3% are people with disabilities. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</span>","'This publication was produced .... under REQ-519-12-000021, ,,,,' ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Improving access to employment program in El Salvador = Programa para mejorar el acceso al empleo en El Salvador ~|~_©_~|~ Spanish ed.: PD-ACU-556 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-09-00016",Special Evaluation,Documents,RAN-I-00-09-00016-00 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00016-00,,10/1/2012 0:00,,Employment ~|~_©_~|~ Employment services ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Economic growth ~|~_©_~|~ Labor force ~|~_©_~|~ Labor market ~|~_©_~|~ Occupational opportunities,El Salvador,EEM-I-00-07-00006-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU555.pdf,2021 KB,"001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

PD-ACY-224,"The Asia's Regional Response to Endangered Species Trafficking (ARREST) program, funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Regional Development Mission for Asia (RDMA) Regional Environment Office (REO), promotes a three-pronged approach to curb wildlife trafficking through: (1) reduction in consumption of endangered species in key markets in Asia by reducing consumer demand; (2) reduction in poaching and trafficking of endangered species across Asia by strengthening law enforcement capacity; and (3) continuation and sustainability of these positive trends beyond the life of the program by strengthening and sustaining regional learning networks and partnerships.&nbsp; The purpose of the mid-term evaluation was to reflect upon program implementation to date and look forward to opportunities for increased program success and sustainability.&nbsp; The evaluation was framed by three objectives: (1) assess progress to date toward agreed-upon program objectives and intermediate results; (2) identify implementation challenges, corrective actions, and/or areas for improvement related to program management and achievement of expected results for the duration of the program period; and (3) recommend specific opportunities to enhance regional level impact and further strengthen the regional Wildlife Enforcement Network (WEN) and sustainability approach.&nbsp; The evaluation concluded that the ARREST program is off to a strong start and important progress has been made by the Freeland Foundation and its partners on many elements of the program during its first two years, particularly in its law enforcement training and capacity-building activities.&nbsp; ARREST is exceptionally well positioned to help address rising USG interest in and concern about wildlife trafficking both regionally and globally, including its intersection with a broad range of other high-priority issues such as transnational drug and human trafficking crimes and emerging pandemic threats resulting from the illegal transport of live animals across borders without health inspections.&nbsp; The program is on track to meet many of the activity-level results as set out in the Performance Management Plan (PMP).&nbsp; Results to date at the Intermediate Results (IR) level of the Results Framework (RF) -- the level from which the key evaluation questions have been drawn -- are varied:&nbsp; modest progress in reducing consumer demand, significant progress in strengthening law enforcement capacity and mixed progress in strengthening and sustaining regional learning networks and partnerships.&nbsp; Extensive input from document review and key informant interviews in five countries (China, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam) identified a number of ways in which the ARREST program can be strengthened during its remaining three years.&nbsp; Key recommendations are included in the report along with suggested lead responsible parties and entities to implement the recommendations.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Cover title: Mid-term performance evaluation of Asia's regional response to endangered species trafficking program ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Asia's regional response to endangered species trafficking (ARREST),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-486-TO-13-00004 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00019 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00019-00,,10/1/2013 0:00,,Endangered species ~|~_©_~|~ Animals ~|~_©_~|~ Crimes ~|~_©_~|~ Hides and skins ~|~_©_~|~ Wildlife hunting ~|~_©_~|~ Protected wildlife areas ~|~_©_~|~ International law ~|~_©_~|~ Law enforcement ~|~_©_~|~ Public awareness,Asia ~|~_©_~|~ Southeast Asia ~|~_©_~|~ Indonesia,AID-486-A-11-00006,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACY224.pdf,2667 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,"011460 - USAID.

PD-ACY-106,"The intervention, referred to as house helps Health and Life skills project (HELP), was implemented in September 2009 to June 2010 in collaboration with interested faith-based organizations (FBOs) and involved raising awareness among congregants of the FBO and the surrounding community, as well as offering health and life skills training on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV and unintended pregnancy prevention to house girls. &nbsp;The girls were taken through a seven module curriculum covering: (1) self-esteem and communication skills; (2) sexual and reproductive health (SRH); (3) STIs including HIV prevention and protection; (4) sexual violence, alcohol and drug abuse; (5) personal savings and financial management; (6) basic household safety and security; and, (7) basic first aid. &nbsp;The overall goal of this evaluation was to describe the effect of the intervention on house girls' knowledge and practices as relates to HIV and unintended pregnancy prevention. &nbsp;Specifically, the objectives were: (1) to examine house girls' sources of vulnerability to STIs including HIV and unintended pregnancy, their post training knowledge of these subjects, and their sexual and reproductive health behaviors; (2) to describe house girls' capacity to take risk-reduction action on STIs including HIV and unintended pregnancies; (3) to descriptively compare the outcomes of the intervention in areas characterized by differences in the socioeconomic status of the population; and (4) to determine perceptions and attitudes towards the program by the house girls, their employers and church members. &nbsp;Overall, the study has demonstrated that the training provided an opportunity for the house girls to receive information that otherwise proved elusive to them given the nature of their work. &nbsp;Improved self-esteem and efficacy and the increased financial management realized among the house girls have been directly attributed to their participation in the project by the house girls themselves, their employers and by the church members interviewed. &nbsp;Increased knowledge on STIs (including HIV prevention) and prevention of unintended pregnancies was realized. &nbsp;After the training the house girls said that their communication skills improved, they had better appreciation of their work and they were more confident. &nbsp;These same observations were made by the employers and church members as well. &nbsp;Reservations about the training as expressed by the employers included fear that the house girls would leave once trained and the time spent by the house girls during training. &nbsp;All in all, employers, church members and the house girls would recommend the project to others. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",Evaluated project title: Health and life skills project (HELP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Project title: Contraceptive and reproductive health technology research and utilization (CRTU) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Preventive technologies agreement (PTA),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,GPO-A-00-05-00022-00 ~|~_©_~|~ GHO-A-00-09-00016-00,,1/1/2013 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Condoms ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Family health care ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Girls ~|~_©_~|~ Houses ~|~_©_~|~ Pregnancy,Kenya,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACY106.pdf,702 KB,009154 - Family Health International (FHI),,013626 - U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) ~|~_©_~|~ 011262 - USAID.

PD-ACY-050,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">The Child Survival and Health Grants Program (CSHGP), has been, since 1985, USAID&rsquo;s primary central vehicle for enlisting the support of U.S. PVOs to engage in community-oriented programming for child survival.&nbsp; It has three components: (1) small scale country-based cooperative agreements with U.S. PVOs and NGOs, selected through an annual competitive process; (2) technical assistance (TA) through the Maternal and Child Health Integrated Program (MCHIP) to support PVO work in rigorous monitoring and evaluation, maternal and child health (MCH) technical areas, operations research techniques and use of evidence, and reporting; and (3) networking for collaboration to strengthen leadership in community health through the Child Survival Collaborations and Resources (CORE) Group PVO/NGO coalition.&nbsp; As of October 2012, the CSHGP portfolio consisted of 34 projects implemented in 26 countries by 23 U.S. PVOs.&nbsp; The purpose of this evaluation is to inform the U.S. Agency for International Development's (USAID's) future investment in partnerships and strategies to improve development impact as a part of the agency's reform agenda, USAID Forward.&nbsp; The evaluation places particular focus on the role played by U.S. private voluntary organizations (PVOs)/non-governmental organizations (NGOs) intermediaries and their local partners to accelerate progress for current and emerging priorities in health, particularly ending preventable child and maternal deaths.&nbsp; This evaluation covers the period since 2003, after CSHGP moved to the Bureau for Global Health (BGH).&nbsp; Based on the evaluation findings about strengths and weaknesses of the CSHGP in light of USAID's strategic priorities and future needs and proven PVO capabilities, there is a future role for U.S. PVOs, among other partners, in ending preventable child and maternal deaths. CSHGP has supported many &nbsp;of the strengths of PVOs, but there are elements of the program's structure and management that have limited grantee contributions. CSHGP no longer provides an effective vehicle to take advantage of potential contributions of U.S. PVOs and their local partners in community-oriented programming to accelerate ending preventable child and maternal deaths, and suggests programming options that could contribute significantly to BGH and global needs.

PD-ACX-771,"This evaluation of evaluations, or meta-evaluation, was undertaken to assess the quality of USAID's evaluation reports. &nbsp;The study builds on USAID's practice of periodically examining evaluation quality to identify opportunities for improvement. &nbsp;It covers USAID evaluations completed between January 2009 and December 2012. &nbsp;During this four-year period, USAID launched an ambitious effort called USAID Forward, which aims to integrate all aspects of the Agency's programming approach, including program and project evaluations, into a modern, evidence-based system for realizing development results. &nbsp;A key element of this initiative is USAID's Evaluation Policy, released in January 2011. &nbsp;The meta-evaluation on which this volume reports systematically examined 340 randomly selected evaluations and gathered qualitative data from USAID staff and evaluators to address three questions: (1) to what degree have quality aspects of USAID's evaluation reports, and underlying practices, changed over time; (2) at this point in time, on which evaluation quality aspects or factors do USAID's evaluation reports excel and where are they falling short; and (3) what can be determined about the overall quality of USAID evaluation reports and where do the greatest opportunities for improvement lie. &nbsp;The overall picture of evaluation quality at USAID from this study is one of improvement over the study period, with strong gains emerging on key factors between 2010 and 2012. &nbsp;The number of evaluations per year increased, and the quality of evaluation reports has improved. &nbsp;While this portrait is largely positive, the study also identified evaluation quality factors, or standards, that USAID evaluation reports do not yet meet. &nbsp;On several core evaluation quality standards -- such as clear distinctions among evaluation findings, conclusions, and recommendations -- performance was found to be below USAID standards. &nbsp;Other significant deficiencies included the small percentage of evaluations that indicated that an evaluation specialist was a member of the evaluation team, which USAID has required for the better part of a decade, and low ratings on the presence of sex-disaggregated data at all results levels -- not simply for input level activities. &nbsp;Low ratings were also found for several evaluation standards introduced in the 2011 Evaluation Policy, but this may simply reflect slow uptake or lack of awareness of standards. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",,Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-M-11-00026,,8/1/2013 0:00,,Evaluation methodology ~|~_©_~|~ Development policy ~|~_©_~|~ Development planning ~|~_©_~|~ Implementation ~|~_©_~|~ Data quality,,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX771.pdf,2859 KB,"003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

PD-ACY-100,"The USAID/Ecuador Sustainable Forests and Coasts (SFC) project is a biodiversity conservation effort for the Ecuadoran Coast. &nbsp;The project focuses on four ecosystems: (1) coastal rainforest of the Choco biogeographic region; (2) dry forests along the central and southern coast; (3) mangroves; and (4) other near shore coastal/marine areas. &nbsp;Each of these ecosystems harbours biodiversity that has been dramatically reduced in recent decades. &nbsp;The project's implementation strategy remains focused on reducing the following four main threats to biodiversity conservation in six priority sites along the coast of Ecuador: (1) loss and/or alteration of critical habitats; (2) climate change; (3) lack of economic alternatives; and (4) insufficient institutional capacity for biodiversity conservation. &nbsp;For each of the project sites a set of specific threats have been identified that are addressed through targeted activities to reduce the pressure on local ecosystems. &nbsp;The strategic components, or project intermediate results (PIRs) of this project are threefold: (1) to improve biodiversity conservation in critical habitats by designing resource management strategies that address biodiversity threats and strengthening the capacity of stakeholders to implement natural resource management best practices in critical terrestrial and coastal marine areas, especially in habitats located in government protected areas (PAs); (2) to improve local livelihoods by supporting priority activities that ensure sustainable use of the resource base for commodities in the value chain; and (3) to nurture and develop partnerships formed for ongoing support to biodiversity conservation. &nbsp;Evaluation questions included: (1) to what extent is the project on target to achieve its intended results; (2) does the initial project design, and the assumptions on which it was based, still make sense; (3) what are the priority activities for the remaining period of the project to achieve success and what changes, if any, should the project make to ensure the timely organized closure of its work; (4) to what extent will the project's activities be able to continue after the close of the project, and might there be steps that the project can take to ensure greater sustainability; (5) what are the respective views of USAID, relevant government officials at the local and national levels (e.g. Ministry of Environment, Guayas Provincial Government), implementers, and beneficiaries with respect to strengths and weaknesses in the design, implementation, and management of the project's activities; and (6) what are the key tools, threats, and opportunities that USAID should consider regarding conservation and sustainable forestry actions in coastal Ecuador? &nbsp;The evaluation finds that the SFC project has met expectations. &nbsp;There is generally widespread, although not unanimous, agreement among stakeholders that the project has successfully achieved meaningful results. &nbsp;The evaluation process supports this assessment. &nbsp;Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",Evaluated project title: Sustainable forest and coast (SFC),Special Evaluation,Documents,EPP-I-00-06-00013-00,,8/1/2013 0:00,,Sustainable development ~|~_©_~|~ Forestry ~|~_©_~|~ Integrated coastal management ~|~_©_~|~ Environmental protection ~|~_©_~|~ Natural resource conservation ~|~_©_~|~ Landscape conservation,Ecuador,EPP-I-00-06-00013-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACY100.pdf,1196 KB,040612 - Mentefactura Cia.

PD-ACY-091,"<div>Originally conceived under the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005, the Sustainable Water and Sanitation in Africa (SUWASA) project was designed to provide water and sanitation services to underserved populations in Africa. &nbsp;The project aimed to address the following needs: (1) African governments lack sufficient regulatory and corporate governance tools to enable local utilities that are technically and financially capable to provide quality water and sanitation services to their customers in a cost-effective and sustainable way; (2) African utilities were ineffective and inefficient because they were not sufficiently developed or trained in effective revenue collection, in addressing leakage problems in water distribution systems, or in customer relations; and (3) utility services to the poor are expensive, not uniformly available, and not of high quality. &nbsp;The design of the SUWASA project emphasized the role that institutional reform would play to improve direct service delivery in providing access to water and sanitation services and included: (1) the development of cost-based tariffs, a process by which tariffs are adjusted; (2) development of governing boards overseeing and planning utility operations and investment; and (3) training provided at the local utility level. &nbsp;The main goal of the evaluation was to provide USAID with an external assessment of SUWASA to date, its ability to integrate other complementary development activities, and its effectiveness at improving sector performance, measured by documented results and the perceptions of stakeholders. &nbsp;The five salient evaluation questions focused primarily on five corresponding premises: (1) contribution to the body of solutions; (2) maximum development impact and aid effectiveness; (3) value of service provider; (4) positive country-level reform; and (5) correctly designed, managed, and implemented project. &nbsp;The evaluation presents findings, conclusions, and recommendations for each SUWASA country, followed by overall conclusions and recommendations. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</div>",'Prepared under Water II IQC: EPP-1-00-05-00010-00; Water Sector CKM Task Order Number: AID-OAA-TO-12-00002' ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order title: Sustainable water and sanitation in Africa (SUWASA),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-TO-12-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ EPP-I-00-05-00010-00,,9/1/2013 0:00,,Water supply ~|~_©_~|~ Sanitation ~|~_©_~|~ Water sanitation ~|~_©_~|~ Sustainable development,Ethiopia ~|~_©_~|~ Kenya ~|~_©_~|~ Liberia ~|~_©_~|~ Mozambique ~|~_©_~|~ Nigeria ~|~_©_~|~ Senegal ~|~_©_~|~ South Sudan ~|~_©_~|~ Uganda ~|~_©_~|~ Zambia ~|~_©_~|~ Africa south of Sahara,EPP-00-04-00019-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-EPP-00-04-00019,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACY091.pdf,2144 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates,,008308 - USAID.

PD-ACX-518,"The program cycle is a core mechanism by which Bureau of Policy, Planning and Learning (PPL) works to instill a ""discipline of development"" in the agency. &nbsp;It is at the center of USAID's efforts to achieve results and contributes to the broader objectives of USAID Forward, the Policy Framework (2011&ndash;2015), and higher level government-wide policies embodied in the Presidential Policy Directive 6 on Global Development and the joint Department of State-USAID Quadrennial Diplomacy and Development Review. &nbsp;Over the course of 2010-2012, PPL issued seven policies and strategies, country development cooperation strategy (CDCS) and project design guidance, a draft learning guide, and revisions of ADS 201 and 202. &nbsp;PPL offices initially provided support to USAID missions on an ""on-demand"" basis, but adjusted their approaches to support over time, based on feedback and learning. &nbsp;PPL engaged EnCompass LLC to assess the effectiveness, utility and extent to which the bureau's policies, reforms and activities are influencing agency planning, programming, operations and budgetary decision-making, especially in missions. &nbsp;The evaluation was specifically designed to provide PPL with a greater understanding of how well the program cycle has been understood, implemented, supported and integrated into organizational culture, and to inform PPL's strategy for deeper integration and institutionalization of the program cycle. &nbsp;The evaluation addressed the following questions: (1) to what extent are USAID missions effectively implementing and other stakeholders effectively supporting implementation of the program cycle; (2) to what extent are PPL program cycle products and services meeting the needs of missions and others in the Agency; (3) what factors internal to PPL enable or constrain its effectiveness related to the program cycle; and (4) what is needed to facilitate institutionalization of the program cycle. &nbsp;Overall, the concept of the program cycle has been well-received by USAID staff who perceive it as returning to a more rigorous, evidence-based, approach to programming. &nbsp;All program cycle components assessed during the evaluation are perceived as adding value to USAID's work, although missions particularly struggle with implementation of the project design processes. &nbsp;Primary responsibility for implementing the program cycle in missions rests with foreign service officers (FSOs) with critical support from foreign service nationals (FSNs). &nbsp;Uptake and implementation have been hindered by the exceptionally high volume of new policies and guidance issued over the past three years by PPL and agency initiatives (presidential or otherwise). &nbsp;The ""roll out"" of the program cycle appeared to lack an overall plan to introduce and facilitate its reception and use in missions. &nbsp;The evaluation concludes that the program cycle marks an important paradigm shift for the USAID, but institutionalization will not occur through promulgation of new guidance and policies alone. Mission staff wishes for a slower pace, better policy integration, training, and active support from PPL, regional and pillar bureaus on the program cycle. &nbsp;PPL is adjusting its approach to program cycle support based on feedback and learning. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","""Evaluation Mechanism No.M/OAA/GRO/LMA-12-00800"" ~|~_©_~|~ Related documents: PD-ACX-603, PD-ACX-604, PN-AEC-227, PN-AEC-228",Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-M-12-00021,,9/1/2013 0:00,,Evaluation methodology ~|~_©_~|~ Development policy ~|~_©_~|~ Development planning ~|~_©_~|~ Implementation,,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX518.pdf,2604 KB,"012914 - EnCompass, LLC",,"013312 - USAID.

PD-ACY-083,"The increasing importance of the wildlife management areas (WMAs) in Tanzania, where 17 WMAs are now functioning and 22 others are in various stages of development, begs the question of what successes have been achieved and what challenges remain to be addressed if this Community-Based Conservation model is to be sustained and even scaled up. &nbsp;There has not been a country-wide evaluation of WMAs since the pilot-phase evaluation in 2007 at a time when most WMAs were too new to yield firm projections for the long term. &nbsp;The evaluation team chose five of the nine pilot WMAs for which full baseline studies were available: Wami-Mbiki, Pawaga-Idodi, Ipole, Burunge, and Enduimet. &nbsp;All five had been officially launched in 2003 and all had reached fully registered status with user rights by 2007. &nbsp;The four-person evaluation team spent approximately four weeks in the field visiting 15 villages around these five WMAs, at the same time that a 750-person household survey was carried out in 25 villages in the same WMAs. &nbsp;The evaluation had three objectives: (1) assess what have been the key outcomes and achievements of the overall WMA approach for the Tanzanian government, local communities, and conservation of wildlife and other resources in terms of creating increased financial benefits, strengthening governance, improving human-wildlife conflicts, and strengthening wildlife management; (2) Identify whether the policy framework and the WMA institutional structure is effective and sufficient in meeting the overall WMA goal of providing benefits to both communities and wildlife; and (3) identify what opportunities and challenges exist to the sustainability and scaling up of the current approach. &nbsp;The review found that WMAs in Tanzania are presently at a key inflection point in their evolution, with a number of possible future pathways of development. &nbsp;Considerable progress has been made during the past decade in terms of: (1) creating a basic legal and institutional framework for WMAs; (2) supporting communities to establish the basic management structures and land use patterns required to form and oversee WMAs; and (3) building broad support for WMAs as a key component of both conservation and natural resource-related development policies and approaches in Tanzania. &nbsp;However, despite this significant progress, major challenges remain, particularly in the economic and governance realms. &nbsp;New approaches to organizational development of authorized associations (AAs), enterprise development and private sector engagement in WMAs, and larger-scale wildlife sector governance issues will be an important element of continuing support by USAID to WMAs, and create numerous opportunities for future support to be designed in a more strategic way. &nbsp;The recommendations highlight these opportunities and suggest specific steps for developing them. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",Cover title: Tanzania wildlife management areas evaluation : final evaluation report ~|~_©_~|~ Footer title: Tanzania WMA evaluation : final evaluation report ~|~_©_~|~ Submitted as: Tanzania wildlife management evaluation,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,,,7/1/2013 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural production ~|~_©_~|~ Business enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Households ~|~_©_~|~ Livestock ~|~_©_~|~ Villages,Tanzania,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACY083.pdf,1616 KB,013576 - Tetra Tech ARD ~|~_©_~|~ 040876 - Maliasili Initiatives,,008612 - USAID.

PD-ACX-191,"USAID's Water User Association Support Program (WUASP) has been successful in Tajikistan.&nbsp; It has met its objectives to help farmers establish water user associations (WUAs), support them to clean and rehabilitate irrigation infrastructure, and improve their productivity through training in business, water management, and good governance and democratic principles.&nbsp; Thanks to this training, WUAs are, in general, institutionally and financially sustainable organizations that are responsive to their constituencies, and can resolve water management issues.&nbsp; By overcoming the limiting factor of irrigation water, farmers have opened up more land, grown more crops and diversified their on-farm activities.&nbsp; In many ways, the role and responsibilities of WUAs are expanding.&nbsp; Given the lack of a functioning extension service in Tajikistan, the WUAs are becoming more like farm associations that look at the entire farm management cycle and tackle the problems that hinder agricultural growth.&nbsp; Many challenges remain.&nbsp; For example, farmers are under-capitalized, interest rates on loans are high, relations with district water departments can be strained due to water user fee issues, equipment for operating and maintaining irrigation infrastructure is expensive to rent or is in dire need of repair, and legislation on agriculture and water management still needs full improvement.&nbsp; Nevertheless, WUA members have a sense of purpose and unity, and are confident that they can solve their problems.&nbsp; Importantly, WUA members have taken their newly gained knowledge and skills out of the confines of agriculture into the larger arena of their communities, where farmers have applied democratic principles, business knowledge and agricultural skills to other aspects of their life.&nbsp; Such an application and expansion of knowledge and skills underscore that the WUASP-supported WUAs are grassroots organizations actively engaging in civil society.&nbsp; Their continual activities after the life of the project indicate that WUAs have a promising future in shaping the dynamics of society in Tajikistan.&nbsp; (Author abstract)",On cover: USAID | Central Asian Republics ~|~_©_~|~ 'Submitted to: USAID/CAR' ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Water user association support program (WUASP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Integrated water and coastal resources management indefinite quantity contract II (Water IQC II),Special Evaluation,Documents,EPP-I-08-05-00010-00 ~|~_©_~|~ EPP-I-00-05-00010-00,,5/1/2010 0:00,,Integrated coastal management ~|~_©_~|~ Water use ~|~_©_~|~ Irrigation ~|~_©_~|~ Natural resource rehabilitation ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural productivity ~|~_©_~|~ Water management ~|~_©_~|~ Crop diversification ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Economic growth ~|~_©_~|~ Governance,Tajikistan,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX191.pdf,646 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates,,"011544 - USAID.

PD-ACX-675,"The Higher Engineering Education Alliance (HEEAP) program &nbsp;aims to transform engineering education in Vietnam from what is described as ""passive, theory-based instruction to active, project-based instruction"" with the goal of producing ""work-ready"" graduates for the country's booming high-tech sector. &nbsp;The principal development intervention employed to achieve HEEAP's goals was annual training sessions on active learning and curriculum design. &nbsp;Three cohorts totaling 123 Vietnamese lecturers were selected to attend a 6-week training program in Arizona each summer from 2010 to 2012. &nbsp;Three related interventions were designed to assist training participants with promoting changes at their home institutions: (1) a faculty reform project conducted by small groups that were formed during the training and completed after the participants returned; (2) a mentoring system established in conjunction with the faculty projects to support the change process HEEAP aimed to achieve at each university; and (3) a component for leadership outreach and socialization to aid institutional reform. &nbsp;A corollary objective of HEEAP was to help Vietnamese institutions advance toward international accreditation through the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). &nbsp;The intent of the evaluation was to produce a forward-looking assessment whose findings and recommendations could be incorporated into follow-on programs. &nbsp;The Scope of Work (SOW) identified three focus areas for evaluation: (1) project achievements -- the success of HEEAP in advancing cutting-edge instruction, providing a relevant and up-to-date curriculum, improving undergraduate learning outcomes, and garnering institutional support for such reforms -- the approach advanced by HEEAP was tightly aligned to the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET); (2) project monitoring evaluation -- how results achieved by the program are seen and measured by program funders and stakeholders and whether or not current project indicators best reflect the performance of the project; and (3) global development alliance -- the contributions of the Global Development Alliance (GDA) structure to program results over and above the results that could have been achieved by USAID funding alone. &nbsp;Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation focus area. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",Evaluated project title: Higher engineering education alliance program (HEEAP) ~|~_©_~|~ Task order title: Global evaluation and monitoring II (GEM II),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-BC-10-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-EDH-E-00-08-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ EDH-E-00-08-00003-00,,6/1/2013 0:00,,Higher education ~|~_©_~|~ Engineering education ~|~_©_~|~ Educational reform ~|~_©_~|~ Educational development ~|~_©_~|~ Curriculum design ~|~_©_~|~ Learning motivation,Vietnam,AID-486-A-10-00010,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX675.pdf,1079 KB,"013070 - JBS International, Inc.

(JSI)/DELIVER Project started its operation in Pakistan in August 2009 with USAID support to provide inputs on the Logistics Management Information System (LMIS), warehouse rehabilitation, commodity security, procurement capacity and other support activities related to contraceptive commodities. &nbsp;The JSI/DELIVER Project works nationally, in all districts of Pakistan, and targets those involved in the contraceptive commodity supply chain. &nbsp;The purpose of JSI/DELIVER is to: (1) improve central warehouse and supply chain operations; (2) improve the procurement capacity of the Government of Pakistan (GOP); (3) improve and increase the supply of contraceptives (through procurement); and (4) establish the LMIS. &nbsp;The project's interventions focus on two key dimensions: (1) improving the performance of the health system by redressing weak supply management systems; and (2) improving the availability of contraceptives in the public sector by working in partnership with the Ministry of Population Welfare (MOPW) and Ministry of Health (MOH) to achieve contraceptive security through a series of interventions in the above mentioned key focus areas. &nbsp;The goal of the mid-term evaluation is to determine the extent to which the program has been successful in building the GOP's capacity (at both the federal and provincial levels) to manage the supply chain of contraceptives effectively and efficiently. &nbsp;The evaluation focused on five specific questions including: (1) to what extent is JSI/DELIVER achieving its objective to institute best practices (human resource management, infrastructure, operationalization and automation) in the central warehouse; (2) to what extent is JSI/DELIVER achieving its objectives to improve procurement capacity; (3) have procurement activities been automated, and is the government using the web-based LMIS procurement manual and linking it to procurement planning and forecasting; (4) to what extent has JSI/DELIVER been effective in building the capacity of federal and provincial governments to manage the contraceptive supply chain using modern technology (LMIS) in the central, provincial and eight sample pilot districts to ensure a continuous supply of contraceptive commodities [and] what factors affect the relative performance of the LMIS across districts; and (5) how widespread and frequent are stock-outs at the central warehouse and district-level stores and what is their cause and when they occur? &nbsp;As the project does not have a baseline or a set of benchmarks against which to measure its achievements, the findings for the five evaluation questions measure current project achievements against its ultimate objectives. &nbsp;Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","'Contracted under No. GS-23F-8012H and Order No. AID-391-M-11-00001, Monitoring and Evaluation Program (MEP)' ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: USAID | DELIVER project ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Independent monitoring and evaluation contract (IMEC)",Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-391-M-11-00001,,2/1/2013 0:00,,Family planning services ~|~_©_~|~ Fertility ~|~_©_~|~ Warehouses ~|~_©_~|~ Economic reconstruction ~|~_©_~|~ Contraceptive distribution ~|~_©_~|~ Logistics ~|~_©_~|~ Transportation infrastructure ~|~_©_~|~ Health commodities ~|~_©_~|~ Inventories ~|~_©_~|~ Supply chains,Pakistan,GPO-I-00-06-00007-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GPO-I-00-06-00007,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX670.pdf,1406 KB,"003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

PD-ACX-669,"The Nyungwe National Park (NNP) is an approximately 1,019 square kilometer park in southwest Rwanda and home to the Nyungwe Forest, a high-altitude, mountainous rainforest along the Albertine Rift.&nbsp; Since 2006, USAID has been continuously investing in the newly established Nyungwe National Park with the objective to accelerate rural economic growth and improve biodiversity conservation in and around the Park via three different projects.&nbsp; These projects include: (1) profitable ecotourism through improved biodiversity conservation in Rwanda -- this project helped the Rwanda Office of Tourism and National Parks (ORTPN) broaden the country's appeal as a tourism destination by developing NNP infrastructure and management capacity; (2) strengthening sustainable ecotourism in and around Nyungwe National Park--the primary objective of the Nyungwe Nziza (NN) project is to sustainably accelerate rural economic growth while contributing to biodiversity conservation in and around Rwanda's NNP and help Rwanda Development Board (RDB) transform NNP into a viable ecotourism destination; and (3) sustaining biodiversity conservation in Nyungwe National Park (SBCNNP) -- this project is a comprehensive landscape program leveraging Wildlife Conservation Society's (WCS) 25-plus years of research and experience working in NNP to reduce threats to the forest and improve biodiversity conservation.&nbsp; The task order statement of work (SOW) stipulated the following primary evaluation objectives: (1) assess the results and achievements of USAID/Rwanda biodiversity programs since 2006 and obtain information about performance; (2) determine the extent to which USAID investments are likely to be sustained; and (3) make recommendations on how current projects can improve performance in the remaining years of the project, as well as recommendations for areas of focus for future USAID investments.&nbsp; The evaluation team finds that all three projects have performed relatively well under challenging circumstances, although they have faced a handful of common or global issues.&nbsp; In general, the evaluation team felt that due to the relatively small size of the NNP program, USAID was unable to give the kind of consistent engagement that would be needed to deal effectively with project implementation issues.&nbsp; Some of the institutional issues and miscommunications might have been forestalled with more consistent engagement at the working technical level and regular strategic engagement at higher levels.&nbsp; Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each project.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Evaluated project title: Profitable ecotourism through improved biodiversity conservation in Rwanda (Destination Nyungwe) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Strengthening sustainable ecotourism in ~|~_©_~|~ and around the Nyungwe National Park (Nyungwe Nziza) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Sustaining biodiversity conservation in Nyungwe ~|~_©_~|~ National Park ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Prosperity, livelihoods and conserving ecosystems indefinite quantity contract (PLACE IQC)",Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-696-TO-13-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ EPP-I-00-06-00010-00,,4/1/2013 0:00,,Landscape conservation ~|~_©_~|~ Protected area managers ~|~_©_~|~ Protected environmental areas ~|~_©_~|~ Protected wildlife areas ~|~_©_~|~ Livelihood ~|~_©_~|~ Ecosystems ~|~_©_~|~ Economic growth,Rwanda,696-C-00-06-00170-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-696-C-00-06-00170 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-696-C-10-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-696-LA-10-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX669.pdf,1402 KB,"008927 - ECODIT, Inc.",,"008598 - USAID.

PD-ACX-653,"Both the Government of Iraq (GoI) and USAID have committed to the goal of strengthening, improving, and modernizing the quality of primary health care services by introducing international standards of care into Iraq. &nbsp;Primary Health Care Project in Iraq (PHCPI) was launched in March 2011 to assist the Iraqi Ministry of Health (MoH) in achieving its goal of better quality primary health care (PHC) services with a specific focus on supporting the delivery of quality services at the community and facility levels. &nbsp;PHCPI consists of three components, namely: (1) strengthening health management systems; (2) improving the quality of clinical services; and (3) encouraging community involvement to increase the demand for and use of PHC services. &nbsp;The purpose of this mid-term evaluation is to determine whether progress is being made toward achieving the PHCPI's development objective of ""Primary Health Care Services Improved"" by examining findings from eight targeted questions: (1) to what extent has the project achieved or made progress towards the planned results to improve PHC services in Iraq; (2) how realistic and appropriate is the project intervention logic; (3) to what extent has the project management structure been effective and how has it been affecting the program outcomes to date; (4) to what extent has the project reached out to vulnerable groups including women, persons with disabilities, and the internally displaced persons (IDPs); (5) is the project's approach appropriate to respond to the needs of vulnerable groups, and if not, how can its approach be improved; (6) how is the training provided by the project being used in the clinics; (7) how is project-purchased equipment (if any) being used in the clinics; and (8) how is the GoI cost-share being utilized? &nbsp;The evaluation finds that PHCPI should continue for its full life until March 2015. &nbsp;While there have been some significant gaps in how the project has been implemented, it has nevertheless laid a foundation for what it is intended to achieve and has made progress toward the Development Objective, as well as fulfilling the terms of its contract. &nbsp;The project will need significant reshaping and rethinking; even so, there are a number of objectives that can be achieved during its remaining time. &nbsp;The project must start by clearly defining which technical areas will be supported by PHCPI, even if this does not align with all of the MoH's requests. &nbsp;Starting with a review of the Basic Health Services Package (BHSP) and its principles, the project needs to lay an evidence-based foundation for its strategic decisions and then ground-truth those suppositions to ensure their applicability. &nbsp;PHCPI and relevant stakeholders (primarily the GoI and USAID) must reach a precise agreement on the focus for the final two years that will produce rapid, tangible, measurable, and realistic improvements in the quality of health care services. &nbsp;PCHPI must ensure that all of the project's various activities are interconnected by thoroughly reviewing them within the framework of a greater strategic vision and what is currently possible within Iraq's primary health care system structure. &nbsp;All stakeholders must be willing to dedicate sufficient human resources for the project's implementation and oversight. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",Evaluated project title: Primary health care project in Iraq (PHCPI) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Iraq personnel support services (Manpower II),Special Evaluation,Documents,267-O-00-08-00507-00,,6/1/2013 0:00,,Primary health care ~|~_©_~|~ Health service utilization ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ International standards ~|~_©_~|~ Health care systems ~|~_©_~|~ Health care administration ~|~_©_~|~ Quality of care ~|~_©_~|~ Clinics ~|~_©_~|~ Community participation ~|~_©_~|~ Demand ~|~_©_~|~ Vulnerable groups ~|~_©_~|~ Internally displaced persons (IDP) ~|~_©_~|~ Gender equality,Iraq,AID-267-C-11-00004,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX653.pdf,1606 KB,,,011765 - USAID.

PD-ACX-232,"In 1984 the National Bipartisan Commission to Central America and the Caribbean (the Kissinger Commission) found that the United States was not sufficiently responsive to the political and civil turmoil in that region.&nbsp; Congress appropriated funding that directed USAID to address this need through participant training of youth, and designated a partner, Georgetown University, through its Center for Intercultural Education and Development (CIED), to implement the LAC Higher Education Scholarship Program.&nbsp; In 1985, the first Central American, Andean, and Caribbean participant training scholarships were launched.&nbsp; The program has provided two-year technical training for economically disadvantaged high school graduates from underserved areas of designated countries across Central America and the Caribbean.&nbsp; These individuals take English language training, which allows them to take standard coursework in the United States along with U.S. peers.&nbsp; They also live with U.S. host families as part of their curriculum.&nbsp; From 1989 through 2008, the program was known as CASS, the Cooperative Association of States for Scholars.&nbsp; Since 2008, it has been known as SEED, Scholarships for Education and Economic Development.&nbsp; This report summarizes the findings of an impact evaluation of the above scholarship programs.&nbsp; The study dealt with program implementation and effects.&nbsp; Implementation was studied by examining service delivery and program costs in relation to other scholarship programs offering similar services.&nbsp; Effects were examined by comparing scholarship recipients to non-recipients who were judged to be outstanding candidates for a scholarship, but were not chosen in the final selection process.&nbsp; This document is organized in relation to the two principal evaluation questions: (1) to what extent did the program provide value for investment?; and (2) did the scholarships enable participating individuals to become leading change agents in their respective professions and communities?&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","""This publication was produced .... under Task Order AID-OAA-BC-10-00001 of the Global Evaluation and Monitoring II Blanket Purchase Agreement, GEM II BPA EDH-E-00-08-00003-00."" ~|~_©_~|~ Related evaluation: An evaluation of the Cooperative Association of States for Scholarships [CASS] program (1994-2001) (PD-ABZ-325) ~|~_©_~|~ Related evaluation: Training impact and development : an evaluation of the impact of the Cooperative Association of States for Scholarships (CASS) program (PD-ABK-526) ~|~_©_~|~ Task order title: Global evaluation and monitoring II (GEM II)",Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-BC-10-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-EDH-E-00-08-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ EDH-E-00-08-00003-00,,2/1/2013 0:00,,Higher education ~|~_©_~|~ Scholarships ~|~_©_~|~ Community development ~|~_©_~|~ Occupational opportunities ~|~_©_~|~ Community leadership ~|~_©_~|~ Change agents ~|~_©_~|~ Free trade ~|~_©_~|~ Trade agreements,Mexico ~|~_©_~|~ Latin America ~|~_©_~|~ Guatemala ~|~_©_~|~ El Salvador,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX232.pdf,1024 KB,"013875 - JBS International, Inc.",,000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID),English,application/pdf,,,"Chesterfield, Ray ~|~_©_~|~ Dant, William",Higher education,Feb-13,,,,Evaluation of LAC higher education scholarships program,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTc1NTEx,Latin American Regional,,,2013-02-01,2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PD-ACX-654,"In 2005, Hospice Africa Uganda (HAU) signed a cooperative agreement with USAID Uganda. &nbsp;The program was entitled ""Expanding the access to and scope of Palliative Care for People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) and their families"". &nbsp;The overall objective of the program was to increase access to and utilization of quality palliative care service by PLHIV's and their immediate families. &nbsp;Aims of the Palliative Care Program were: (1) improving access to holistic Palliative Care for PLHA's and their immediate families; (2) strengthening specialist palliative care competencies within the public, private, faith based and civil society HIV/AIDS service providers; and (3) influencing national policy to reposition pain, symptoms management and end of life care within the overall health and HIV/AIDS care delivery. &nbsp;The purpose of the evaluation was to present an independent opinion on the impact of expanding coverage and access of Palliative Care services (PC) through the Hospice Africa Uganda program over the last 5 years. &nbsp;The evaluation was also intended to document lessons learned and best practices developed from the implemented program. &nbsp;The key evaluation questions included: (1) HAU has training care providers as one of its major approaches--were the trainings delivered effectively and efficiently; (2) how well has HAU design and structure addressed factors facilitating or hindering palliative care giving [and] what was the value-addition of HAU sub-partners; (3) analyze the relevance of palliative care in the era of expanding access to Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART); (4) how effective has HAU been in influencing national policy and practice on palliative care; (5) what is the likelihood that this program will be successful [and] given the rate of achievement of results and current approaches and activities, assess the prospect that this project will achieve all its intended results; (6) how sustainable are HAU activities and results[and] suggest modifications to increase sustainability; and (7) what are the lessons Learned and best practices? &nbsp;The evaluation team concludes the following: (1) the HAU program is most likely to be successful; however, certain elements of holistic PC services like psycho-social and spiritual care delivery need to be strengthened; (2) HAU trainings effectively and efficiently transferred specialized PC skills [and] Implementing Partners (IPs) now must take this forward, integrating PC in AIDS care and treatment, and rolling out trainings through Continuous Medical Education (CMEs); (3) the 2009-2013 program design and structure satisfactorily addressed the hindrances identified at end-phase 1 evaluation, and leveraged the facilitating factors [and] emerging hindrances were identified mostly at facility/district level; (4) PC remains relevant even with expanding ART [and] PLHIV on ART suffer pains, psychosocial and spiritual needs, yet for Uganda, less than 10% of PLHIV in need have accessed PC; (5) although the policy influence targets were satisfactorily achieved, the short term outcomes are not yet translated into budget allocations for PC activities and they remain unknown at district and facility levels; and (6) the HAU PC program has established several structures for sustainability, though considered to be at infancy. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",Title in footer: End of program evaluation : PC HAU 2009-2013,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,617-A-00-05-00010-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 617-A00-05-00010-00,,2/1/2013 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Health facilities ~|~_©_~|~ Health workers ~|~_©_~|~ Hospitals ~|~_©_~|~ Military ~|~_©_~|~ Nurses ~|~_©_~|~ Trainees,Uganda,617-A-00-05-00010-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX654.pdf,733 KB,040195 - Multiple Management Consult (MMC),,008618 - USAID.

PD-ACX-662,"<div>Humana People to People responded to the epidemic in South Africa by creating the Total Control of the Epidemic (TCE) program in 2000. &nbsp;The TCE program is a grassroots one-on-one communication and mobilization program that has run since 2002 with the aim of reaching every person in a community with information, education, and HIV/AIDS counselling and testing. &nbsp;The aim of creating TCE was to mobilize people for action, so that they could take control of HIV &amp; AIDS and help each other to deal with the consequences of the epidemic. &nbsp;The ultimate goal of the TCE program is to contribute to the reduction in the incidence of HIV infections. &nbsp;The anticipated outcomes of the TCE program are articulated in terms of changes in knowledge, attitudes, behaviours and skills. &nbsp;These include: (1) changed attitudes and behaviour of community members and members of most at risk groups, manifest as community members consistently use HIV prevention services, community members have undertaken HCT and know their HIV status, community members avoid risky sexual behaviour and use condoms correctly and consistently, and community members no longer discriminate against People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA); (2) increased knowledge around HIV transmission and HIV and AIDS prevention and treatment; (3) the capacity of local leaders built regarding HIV and AIDS prevention, care and support and stigma reduction; and (4) local leaders develop facilitation and counselling skills. &nbsp;The evaluation sets out to assess: (1) the extent to which the TCE program led to changes in knowledge, attitudes and behaviour with regards to the HIV and AIDS epidemic, as well as the extent to which Humana TCE is responsible for measured effects in a multi-intervention environment; (2) whether the capacity of local leaders has been built to facilitate HIV and AIDS prevention in their communities; and (3) what additional impacts, both positive and detrimental, that may be attributed to the Humana TCE programe. &nbsp;Humana TCE is undoubtedly effective in increasing knowledge about HIV and AIDS, improving attitudes of personal responsibility, and significantly improving health seeking behaviours amongst beneficiaries. &nbsp;It achieves these results through a robust theory of change, program design that relies on innovative behaviour change and monitoring mechanisms, and a compelling message of assuming personal responsibility for your behaviour, your status, your health and that of other members in your community. &nbsp;However, despite this apparently comprehensive program design and strong effects on every other measure, the key objective of changing sexual behaviour is elusive. &nbsp;Perceptions of the effectiveness of Humana TCE are at risk of being undermined by an inconsistent system for registering households reached. &nbsp;Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each assessment objective. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</div> <div></div>","""Comissioned by PactSouth Africa under Associate Award No. 027A0070"" ~|~_©_~|~ Title in footer: Humana TCE Programme evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Submitted as: Evaluation of the humana total control of the epidemic (TCE) programme in Mpumalanga and Limpopo",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,674-A-00-08-00001-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-674-A-00-08-00001,,4/1/2013 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Condoms ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Feedback ~|~_©_~|~ Households ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion,South Africa,674-A-00-08-00001-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-674-A-00-08-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX662.pdf,1697 KB,"040526 - Feedback Research and Analytics (FeedbackRA) ~|~_©_~|~ 013495 - Pact, Inc.",,013626 - U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) ~|~_©_~|~ 008605 - USAID.

PD-ACX-458,"MTPDS was a three-year, $19.9 million USAID-funded program designed to improve learning outcomes for Malawi's primary school children.&nbsp; The program was implemented through three discrete ""packages"" of support, implemented at the school level: (1) Level 1 &ndash; National Continuous Professional Development: CPD in-service teacher training includes modules on literacy and leadership that reach all 36,080 Standard 1&ndash;4 teachers in all 34 education districts nationwide through in-service training conducted over weekends and school holidays; (2) Level 2 &ndash; Intensive Literacy Intervention: This includes CPD plus additional days of training, scripted lesson plans, and the Nditha Kuwerenga Reader for every Standard 1 student in the seven target districts; (3) Level 3 &ndash; Coaching: This includes all previous interventions plus coaching by MTPDS and Primary Education Advisors (PEA) (select schools in Salima and Ntchisi).&nbsp; USAID/Malawi commissioned an evaluation of the MTPDS activity comprised of two complementary components.&nbsp; An impact evaluation (IE) approach was to assess the differential impact and costeffectiveness of the three levels of treatment intensity on student learning in reading.&nbsp; A performance evaluation approach was to document lessons learned and to assess progress towards sustainability (specifically the handing over of the national CPD program to the MoEST).&nbsp; The four-person evaluation team utilized a multi-level, mixed-methods approach to gain both a breadth and depth of information.&nbsp; These methods included: document review, data quality assessment (DQA), direct observation, key informant interviews (KII), focus group discussions (FGD), mini-surveys, and a statistical analysis of quantitative data to derive impact and associated cost-effectiveness estimates.&nbsp; Each technique facilitated triangulation of data during the analysis and reporting phases&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified).","""Requisition no: REQ-612-12-000029"" ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order:  Malawi teacher professional development support (MTPDS)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-612-TO-13-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00019 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00019-00,,5/1/2013 0:00,,Teacher education ~|~_©_~|~ Professional development ~|~_©_~|~ Literacy ~|~_©_~|~ Performance measurement ~|~_©_~|~ Cost-effectiveness ~|~_©_~|~ Access to education ~|~_©_~|~ Enrollment ~|~_©_~|~ Quality of education ~|~_©_~|~ Reading skills ~|~_©_~|~ Writing skills ~|~_©_~|~ Primary schools ~|~_©_~|~ Efficiency ~|~_©_~|~ Leadership training,Malawi,EDH-I-04-05-00026-00 ~|~_©_~|~ EDH-I-00-05-00026-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-EDH-I-04-05-00026 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-EDH-I-00-05-00026,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX458.pdf,980 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,"008573 - USAID.

PD-ACX-375,"This is a report of a performance evaluation of the Support to Sub-national Governance Structures (SNG) project implemented by the National Democratic Institute (NDI or the Institute), which has been working in Afghanistan since 2002.&nbsp; The SNG project began in June, 2008; USAID funding was on the basis of a Cooperative Agreement that was signed with NDI, with two major modifications in March 2011 and July 2012.&nbsp; The 14-month extension described in the latter modification ends in September 2013.&nbsp; This was the first evaluation of this project, and its Statement of Work had two main objectives: to assess NDI's performance in supporting the operations of Provincial Councils (PCs) across Afghanistan, and to provide information that USAID can use to decide how best to support subnational governance after this project ends in 2013.&nbsp; This was essentially a dual performance evaluation, in that it assessed the effectiveness of NDI's support for the PCs, which in turn required assessment of how the PCs were working in their provinces.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Title in footer: Performance evaluation of support to sub-national governance structures (SNG) project ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Support to sub-national governance structures (SNG) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Services under program and project offices for results tracking II (SUPPORT II),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-306-C-12-00012,,2/1/2013 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Parliamentary systems ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Transparency ~|~_©_~|~ Violence against women ~|~_©_~|~ Voting ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Afghanistan,306-A-00-08-00513-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX375.pdf,1482 KB,"000356 - Checchi and Co.

PD-ACX-327,"The devastating earthquake of January 2010 has increased the risks of food insecurity within poor rural households in the Grande-Anse department of Haiti. &nbsp;In November 2010, Hurricane Thomas worsened the vulnerability of the Grande-Anse population by destroying assets from agriculture and fishing in the department. In the commune of Moron, households reporting losing 90 % of agricultural goods. &nbsp;Those two events combined forced populations living with less than $1 a day to allocate more than 60% of its income to food. &nbsp;Soon after, a cholera epidemic broke out in Haiti, with the heaviest number of cases reported in the Grande-Anse. &nbsp;Studies revealed that the hurricane and cholera outbreak, along with rising food prices, greatly increased family vulnerability. &nbsp;In addition, an increased number of orphans augmented the risks of health issues for children including malnutrition. &nbsp;To tackle the aforementioned problem, CARE submitted a proposal to USAID/Food for Peace addressing food insecurity concerns for populations in nine communes of the Grande-Anse department. &nbsp;Approved by USAID, this project named ""Electronic Food Voucher program &ndash; Kore L'avni Nou"", aimed to support 12,000 vulnerable families (72,000 individuals) with a $50 (2,000 HTG) monthly voucher over a six month period. &nbsp;In addition, 68 local shops were approved to supply beneficiaries with the following key commodities: rice, vegetable oil, maize and beans, forming a minimum food basket and required kilocalories per family per month. &nbsp;The goals of this evaluation were: (1) identify and evaluate program outcomes, intended and unintended, positive or negative and impact on beneficiaries versus non-beneficiaries; (2) overview data collected on a regular basis and present performance monitoring (strengths, weaknesses), triangulate with final evaluation collected data for better understanding; (3) determine the adequacy of program design to meet the identified needs in the target area; (4) compare final conditions with baseline findings and present persisting gaps in coping strategies used by the households to mitigate vulnerability; (5) relate lessons learned to appropriate stakeholders; (6) identify key obstacles preventing a correct program execution; and (7) identify key successes and recommendations for future consideration. &nbsp;Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation goal. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","""Submitted to CARE Haiti""",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,,,2/1/2013 0:00,,Food aid programs ~|~_©_~|~ Vouchers ~|~_©_~|~ Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Households ~|~_©_~|~ Beneficiary participation ~|~_©_~|~ Finance ~|~_©_~|~ Telephones ~|~_©_~|~ Access to education ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Commodities,Haiti,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX327.pdf,2200 KB,040505 - Diagnostic & Development Group (DDG) ~|~_©_~|~ 010850 - CARE USA,,000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID),English,application/pdf,,,"Pierreval, Isnel ~|~_©_~|~ Zephyr, Luckny ~|~_©_~|~ Lachaud, James",Food aid programs,Feb-13,,,,Final evaluation of the project Kore L'Avni Nou food voucher programme implemented by CARE in the Department of Grande-Anse,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTcwMDUy,Haiti,,,2013-02-01,2013,HTI,HTI_2013,0.07114739499575701,0.46572937914589396,0.8192267502612328,,,0.222222222222222,,0.16293998471965698,0.192034072830708,,0.278093076049943,,,0.637392940281218,0.404090085425835,0.21296296296296302,,HTI,2013,3.0,0.24388819467343928,4.0,0.41504768170027867,MRT_2018,PAK_2015,PAK_2014,EGY_2017,IRQ_2018

PD-ACW-279,"Kabeho Mwana (Life for a Child) was implemented from October 2006 to September 2011 as one of 16 USAID/Child Survival and Health Grants Program (CSHGP)-funded expanded impact projects (EIP) worldwide. It was designed to scale up community case management (CCM) of malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia, and to promote key community-level health promotion and disease prevention actions in Rwanda. Concern Worldwide was the lead agency, and implemented in partnership with the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and World Relief. The project covered six districts in Southern and Eastern Rwanda: Gisagara, Kirehe, Ngoma, Nyamagabe, Nyamasheke, and Nyaruguru, representing one-fifth of the districts of Rwanda and 18% of the countrys total population.The project objectives included:1) Increasing access to prompt first-line treatment for young children with malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia by expanding CCM, strengthening health service delivery systems, and establishing performance contracting for CHW supervision.2) Increasing coverage of key preventive interventions by improving targeting and increasing the breadth of preventive child health services through outreach.3) Increasing adoption of key family health practices through community mobilization and social behavior change.During these five years, the Government of Rwanda (GOR) built on initial efforts at decentralization (2005) to accelerate and nationally scale its community integrated management of childhood illnesses (c-IMCI) approach. Under the governance of the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP), independent efforts of the three NGO partners had already built a positive experience in Home-based Management of Malaria (HBM). As the GOR created the MOHs Community Health Desk (CHD), it established a national policy for integrated Community Case Management (CCM). This generated both high demands on Kabeho Mwana for flexibility, and a supportive environment for achieving results.","""Gisagara, Kirehe, Ngoma, Nyamagabe, Nyaraguru, and Nyamasheke Districts, Rwanda -- October 2006- September 2011"" ~|~_©_~|~ Title in footer: Kabeho mwana -- final evaluation",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,GHS-A-00-05-00018-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GHS-A-00-05-00018,,12/1/2011 0:00,,Child survival activities ~|~_©_~|~ Community development ~|~_©_~|~ Case management ~|~_©_~|~ Malaria ~|~_©_~|~ Diarrhea ~|~_©_~|~ Pneumonia ~|~_©_~|~ Community health care ~|~_©_~|~ Child care ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Adverse health practices ~|~_©_~|~ Community mobilization,Rwanda,GHS-A-00-05-00018-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GHS-A-00-05-00018,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACW279.pdf,1979 KB,013093 - ICF International ~|~_©_~|~ 010283 - Concern Worldwide,,"011222 - USAID.

PD-ACW-267,"The Integrated Community Case Management (iCCM) Project in Benin, award dates from July 30, 2009 to July 29, 2012, was funded by USAID under a contract with the Partnership for Child Health Care, Inc. and implemented by MSH/BASICS.&nbsp; The purpose of the program as defined by USAID/Benin was ""to support implementation of integrated community case management of childhood illnesses among children under-five for malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia, and provide immunization and nutrition messages, by community-based organizations and community health workers."" The focus of the project was on the integrated management of common childhood illnesses, including malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia.&nbsp; The geographic coverage included the five health zones of Kandi-Segbana-Gogounou, Banikoara, Ouak-Copargo, Djougou-Bassila and Tchaourou in the Departments of Alibori, Donga and Borgou.&nbsp; The general objectives of the iCCM evaluation were: (1) to assess the integrated community case management(iCCM) projects achievement of objectives and targets; (2) measure coverage and quality of care of community level service delivery; and (3) attempt to understand the projects contribution to observed results by comparing service coverage and quality in USAID focus health zones with those in non-USAID focus health zones.&nbsp; The evaluation was also designed to assess the capacity and sustainability of health zones and local NGOs to support community level workers and compile lessons learned for scale-up and challenges encountered.&nbsp; Evaluation findings indicate that the project has established good quality iCCM with good coverage in semi-remote (more than 5 km from the nearest health facility) villages in rural Benin using members of local communities.&nbsp; This statement is supported by these results: (1) 1048 community-based community health workers (RCs, 'Relais Communautaire') were trained, equipped and supervised to establish iCCM; (2) over 86,000 clinical contacts took place and children were treated with established standard treatments for malaria, diarrhea and acute respiratory infection; (3) RCs were trained and deployed in 1716 villages, 43% of all villages more than 5 kilometers from the nearest health facility in the five health zones covered by the project; (4) significantly more children were treated at the community level within the first 12 hours of the onset of illness than those in control villages; (5) many patients were receiving treatment who previously did not attend for clinical care and relied on self-medication or traditional healers; and (6) RCs performed an average of 3,000 household visits per year over the last two years of the project to encourage mothers to take preventive action for their child's health.&nbsp; It should be noted, however, that 83% of the RCs are male, which given religious and cultural precepts in Benin, may make prove to be an obstacle to the delivery of maternal health services and family planning as it has in other countries.&nbsp; In addition to these findings, lessons learned and several recommendations are included in the report.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Cover title: USAID/Benin : integrated community case management performance evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Integrated community case management (iCCM) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health technical assistance bridge II (GH tech bridge II),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-C-12-00027,,7/1/2012 0:00,,Case management ~|~_©_~|~ Health care administration ~|~_©_~|~ Health care planning ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Community health workers ~|~_©_~|~ Child health care ~|~_©_~|~ Morbidity ~|~_©_~|~ Mortality ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Disease treatment ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Diarrhea ~|~_©_~|~ Malnutrition,Benin,GHA-I-00-04-00002-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACW267.pdf,3590 KB,"011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

PD-ACW-260,"The Nutrition and HIV Program (NHP) was designed to take the two-year Food by Prescription (FBP) pilot project started in 2006, to scale.&nbsp; As a flagship initiative, NHP goal was to strengthen delivery of nutrition services in and out of hospital settings in Kenya.&nbsp; Objectives included: (1) build on partners expertise in HIV and nutrition, food manufacturing, and logistics, while introducing a new patient-centered concept for clinical service delivery; (2) introduce a locally produced F-100 equivalent RUTF for severely malnourished HIV+ patients and OVC; (3) link Insta (the food partner) and health facilities with care programs for HIV+ patients and OVC to extend the supply chain, improve client tracking, mitigate loss to follow-up, and increase the quality and comprehensive care; (4) scale up interventions while maintaining high quality through performance monitoring and quality assurance systems; and (5) strengthen the capacity of local partners, particularly NASCOP.&nbsp; The evaluators found that: (1) NHP has exceeded targets set out in the cooperative agreement for a number of key areas, including the number of sites providing nutrition assessment counseling and support (NACS) treatment and the number of clients treated by food by prescription (FBP); (2) NHP, with NASCOP, have put in place curricula, resources and training to allow the clinical service delivery of NACS; (3) rapid expansion of sites supporting NACS from 62 to 619 has at the cost of providing quality services.&nbsp; The evaluators make several recommendations for the future: (1) continue to invest in the expansion of NACS program infrastructure, including beyond HIV; (2) separate RFPs for ""commodity component"" for ""service delivery component""; (3) embrace and expand public private partnerships (PPP); (4) improve NACS outcomes through efficient and effective use of FBP and increased focus on other kinds of support; (5) improve quality of NACS service provision by health care providers; (6) clarify and expand the community link component of NACS; (7) support the Government of Kenya to gradually be able to implement all aspects of NACS service provision; and (8) incorporate operations research into the next iteration of NHP.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Evaluated project title: Nutrition and HIV program (NHP),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-623-C-10-00003,,6/1/2012 0:00,,Demographic surveys ~|~_©_~|~ Diseases ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Health ~|~_©_~|~ Nutrition,Kenya,623-A-00-08-00013-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-623-A-00-08-00013,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACW260.pdf,1246 KB,"012990 - IT Shows, Inc.",,012598 - USAID.

PD-ACW-258,"<p>This report presents an evaluation of USAIDs Morocco Civil Society Advocacy Project Strengthening Advocacy and Networking to Advance Democracy (SANAD).&nbsp; SANAD's objective is to develop Moroccan civil society organizations (CSO) capacity to promote democratic reform and advocate on behalf of citizens, particularly the young and the poor, at the national and local levels.&nbsp; This three-year project started on May 25, 2009 and has been extended to November 2012.&nbsp; This evaluation, conducted by the Regional Partnership on Culture and Development (RPCD) from May to July 2012, is based on a review of relevant documents and extensive field work consisting of interviews and focus groups with 73 beneficiary CSOs, ten public institutions, and numerous key stakeholders.&nbsp; The two main purposes served by the evaluation are to provide USAID with a summary of how the project is meeting its objectives and to inform the design of the new country development cooperation strategy (CDCS) and new civil society activities.&nbsp; Overall, the evaluators found that many of the project's qualitative and quantitative objectives were achieved and that there is evidence of positive outcomes for CSOs.&nbsp; One key deliverable met by the project was the provision of services to 450 CSOs.&nbsp; However, not all the projects objectives were achieved, and there are lessons to be learned for future program design.&nbsp; Such lessons include points related to the trade-off between breadth and depth of impact and the importance of tailoring interventions to meet the needs of individual beneficiaries.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)</p>",On cover: Regional partnership on culture and development ~|~_©_~|~ Title in header: SANAD evaluation -  Morocco ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Strengthening advocacy and networking to advance democracy (SANAD),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,,,9/1/2012 0:00,,Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Advocacy ~|~_©_~|~ Democratization ~|~_©_~|~ Networks ~|~_©_~|~ Government reform ~|~_©_~|~ Civil society organizations (CSO) ~|~_©_~|~ Youth ~|~_©_~|~ Poor ~|~_©_~|~ Public awareness,Morocco,263-I-02-06-00008-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 263-I-00-06-00008-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACW258.pdf,914 KB,013682 - FHI 360,,000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID),English,application/pdf,,,,Civil society,2-Sep-12,,,,Evaluation of USAID/Morocco civil society advocacy project (SANAD) : final report,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTY4Mzg3,Morocco,,,2012-09-01,2012,MAR,MAR_2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PD-ACU-991,"USAID/Nigeria's Maximizing Agricultural Revenue and Key Enterprises in Targeted Sites (MARKETS) was a multi-faceted six and a half-year pilot program designed to strengthen agricultural competitiveness and food security in Nigeria.&nbsp; The program began in 2005 with a budget of $24 million which later increased to $51.6 million by the time the project closed in December 2010; after which the project was extended for 16 months (January 2011 through April 2012) with an additional $9.5 million through the Bridge to MARKETS II (BtM2) project.&nbsp; The project was managed by Chemonics International with international and local sub-contractors, MARKETS employed a private sector-led, comprehensive value chain approach that identified commercial buyers and facilitated inputs that supported farmers to meet market standards and a guaranteed buyer.&nbsp; The final evaluation fieldwork of the MARKETS program was conducted in June and July 2012.&nbsp; The evaluation was commissioned by USAID/Nigeria Mission with the aim: (1) to determine whether the goals and objectives of MARKETS were met; (2) establish how effectively MARKETS interventions were delivered; (3) assess project outcomes; (4) assess the extent to which the project affected its beneficiaries; (5) determine whether the USG investment in the program received the greatest possible return; and (6) learn lessons that will guide the implementation of MARKETS II.&nbsp; The final evaluation was guided by eight key evaluation questions on project design, implementation and outcomes.&nbsp; The evaluators found, in general, the value chain approach had a positive impact on the farm level and with agro processors.&nbsp; Production and quality increased two- and three-fold.&nbsp; The value chain approach of this pilot demonstrated notable success stories in linking farmers to formal credit and guaranteed markets.&nbsp; There is still a vast ongoing need for access to credit, consistent output and meeting quality standards of the marketplace.&nbsp; A constraint is that Nigeria small holder farms are still very labor intensive and inefficient.&nbsp; The good news is that the introduction of new technologies was well received and the new production technology adoption rate of was 100 percent.&nbsp; Beneficiary satisfaction is one of the main achievements of the MARKETS pilot program.&nbsp; Satisfaction was very high with increases in yields and related incomes.&nbsp; The beneficiaries expressed their strong interest in ongoing knowledge through trainings and demonstrations as well as improved and certified inputs like seeds, agrochemicals and fertilizer.&nbsp; Likewise the agro processors were largely satisfied with the MARKETS activities and program staff, and most important the results of increased value added commodities and products (132% of the MARKETS target).&nbsp; MARKETS II has been launched and is going more deeply into a fewer number of value chains that meet the current programmatic criteria and priorities&mdash;food security and nutrition, income and job creation and greater benefits to women and youth among others.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",'Report' ~|~_©_~|~ Initial MARKETS contract no. listed in annex as 620-C-00-00077-00 (fiscal year digits missing) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Maximizing agriculture revenue and key enterprises in targeted sties (MARKETS) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Bridge to MARKETS (BtM2),Special Evaluation,Documents,620-C-00-00077-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 620-C-00-11-00004-00,,9/1/2012 0:00,,Agricultural markets ~|~_©_~|~ Revenues ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Economic growth ~|~_©_~|~ Economic competition ~|~_©_~|~ Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Value chains ~|~_©_~|~ Commercial farming ~|~_©_~|~ Income generation,Nigeria,620-C-00-11-00004-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU991.pdf,919 KB,"008360 - The Mitchell Group, Inc.

PD-ACU-968,"The Quality Control and Certification (QCC) Project was designed to support the Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (CCIA) food labs in Saida, Zahle and Tripoli.&nbsp; The objective was to assist the labs to become recognized leading facilities for testing in Lebanon.&nbsp; The project sought to assist the labs with equipment and capacity building so that each lab would achieve ISO 17025 and ISO 9001 accreditation.&nbsp; ISO (International Organization for Standardization) is the internationally recognized body established to ensure that products and services are safe, reliable and of good quality.&nbsp; ISO 17025 is the main ISO standard used by testing and calibration laboratories.&nbsp; ISO 9001 sets the standards for quality management systems.&nbsp; Compliance with the ISO standards ensures that quality management and technical systems are in place that will see the labs consistently produce valid results.&nbsp; Lab accreditation coupled with CCIA certifications allows the CCIA to operate as one-stop export shops and that provide reliable and efficient test results to Lebanese processors.&nbsp; The project came at a time when food safety in Lebanon became a major concern as some Lebanese products were rejected from export markets.&nbsp; High levels of pesticide residue and low-quality standards had affected Lebanon's ability to export.&nbsp; Supporting testing facilities and expanding the range of services outside Beirut was viewed as key for improving the competiveness of the agro-food industry and raising the quality of exported products ultimately resulting in increased exports.&nbsp; Overall the project has succeeded in enhancing Lebanon's export potential by supporting the three CCIA labs in achieving the needed ISO accreditation.&nbsp; Specifically, the key findings of the evaluation include: (1) the CCIA labs in Tripoli and Zahle and Saida achieved ISO 17025 accreditation that is inclusive of ISO 9001 accreditation; (2) all three labs now have the capabilities of one-stop-export shops; (3) QCC has helped the food industry by developing the enabling environment for export so that food processors can demonstrate to the export market that they produce high quality and safe products; (4) lab accreditation and the proximity of the labs to producers will act as a catalyst for increased exports; (5) based on revenue generated from the lab tests reported in income statements, two out of the three labs are currently assessed to be financially sustainable; and (6) none of the clients faced difficulty in export following testing their products in Lebanon and none had their goods returned.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",USAID indefinite quantity contract no. listed on document as RAN-I-00-09-00019,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,RAN-I-00-09-00019-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00019,,8/1/2012 0:00,,Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Economics ~|~_©_~|~ Exports ~|~_©_~|~ Finance ~|~_©_~|~ Management ~|~_©_~|~ Marketing ~|~_©_~|~ Nutrition,Lebanon,EDH-A-00-08-00006-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU968.pdf,1590 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID),English,application/pdf,,,,Agricultural management,Aug-12,,,,Agricultural product quality control and certification (QCC) program : final external evaluation report,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTY3NzYy,Lebanon,,,2012-08-01,2012,LBN,LBN_2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PD-ACU-929,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/Southern Africa commissioned Khulisa Management Services (Khulisa) to conduct an Education Program Performance Evaluation of the Education Support to Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) in South Africa Program (EOVC Project). The EOVC Project was implemented by Research Triangle Institute (RTI Institute) in partnership with the KwaZulu-Natal Department of Education (KZNDOE), MiET Africa and JET Education Services (JET) from 30 April 2009 to 31 August 2011 and had an assigned budget of US$2,399,016, including cost share of US$631,007.Based on the USAID Education Strategy and the KZNDOEs Inclusive Education policy priorities, the EOVC Project was implemented in Sisonke district of KZN, South Africa to support the improvement of OVCs access, performance and retention within the system of education. RTI Internationals proposal was to address the gap between actually assessed OVC needs and the currently available supply of OVC services to improve learner attainment and retention. The project began with a very comprehensive baseline study which included a household survey and learner testing. From this documentation, a design workshop was held to design interventions. Schools were given a menu of these interventions and conditional grants to address their specific needs. When the USAID evaluation policy was launched, the USAID/Southern Africa eliminated the endline comparative survey and commissioned this external evaluation.",Footer title: Final program performance evaluation report : education support to orphans and vulnerable children,Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-674-O-11-00123,,10/1/2011 0:00,,Access to education ~|~_©_~|~ Orphans and vulnerable children (OVC) ~|~_©_~|~ Learning motivation ~|~_©_~|~ Teacher training ~|~_©_~|~ Adult education ~|~_©_~|~ Educational infrastructure ~|~_©_~|~ Public education ~|~_©_~|~ Primary schools ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural education,South Africa,674-A-00-09-00054-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-674-A-00-09-00054,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU929.pdf,1681 KB,010506 - Khulisa Management Services (Pty) Ltd.,,008605 - USAID.

PD-ACU-918,"The Development Communities through Intensive Agriculture Project/Dezenvolve Agricultura Comunitria in Timor-Leste is a USAID-funded contract, implemented by Development Alternatives Inc. (DAI) and hereafter referred to as DOCIA/DAC project.&nbsp; The intention of the project is to complete implementation of a development model that improves the economic and social livelihood of members of households in a poor community in a way that distributes benefits fairly between people of different genders.&nbsp; The DOCIA/DAC project will achieve this by combining two things: (1) the introduction of technology, plant and equipment to a community of poor households; and (2) focused technical and management training of community members.&nbsp; It is anticipated that the community can increase its income and the value of its assets by serving a demanding market that pays premium prices for selected products, and, through increased material wellbeing, will enable the community to improve its social and environmental status.&nbsp; The project was to run for three years from August 30th 2010 through August 31st of 2013, but was recently extended to accommodate a Global Development Alliance (GDA) contribution from ConocoPhillips with matching support from USAID.&nbsp; The completion date is now expected to be August 31st of 2014.&nbsp; After nearly 21 months of implementation, evaluators reviewed the project in three areas: (1) project performance against plan; (2) project results and impacts; and (3) sustainability.&nbsp; Overall, the project is on track to meet or exceed its goals, even while facing many challenges.&nbsp; The technical training by the project of farmers has helped overcome some of these challenges.&nbsp; With regard to sustainability, it appears that the project has capacity building initiatives in place to insure the present approach of ""linking farmers to markets"" is able to be maintained.&nbsp; Evaluators also make 12 recommendations in the report to help with weaknesses and gaps within the project.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","""'Prepared for USAID/Timor-Leste ....""",Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-486-TO-10-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-EDH-I-00-05-00004 ~|~_©_~|~ EDH-I-00-05-00004-00,,6/1/2012 0:00,,Agricultural development ~|~_©_~|~ Community development ~|~_©_~|~ Livelihood ~|~_©_~|~ Socioeconomic development ~|~_©_~|~ Poor ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural technology ~|~_©_~|~ Households ~|~_©_~|~ Income generation ~|~_©_~|~ Training ~|~_©_~|~ Market development,Timor-Leste,AID-486-TO-10-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-EDH-I-00-05-00004 ~|~_©_~|~ EDH-I-00-05-00004-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU918.pdf,780 KB,"006727 - Development Alternatives, Inc.

PD-ACU-908,"<span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"">The purpose of the evaluation was to assess the success of United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Nicaragua's Family Planning (FP) phase-out strategy, including progress on recommendations from the mid-term assessment and for the post-graduation phase. &nbsp;The report is intended to inform USAID and other United States Government personnel, health donors, representatives from the Government (GON), non-governmental and civil society organizations. &nbsp;The USAID Nicaragua's Family Planning Graduation Strategy (FPGS) was implemented from October 1st, 2007 through September 30th, 2012, with a budget of approximately US$ 13.5 million. &nbsp;The implementing partners included John Snow Inc. (DELIVER Project), University Research Co., LL (Health Care Improvement Project), NicaSalud Federation (FamiSalud project) and MSH (PRONICASS Project). &nbsp;Taking into account the USAID Technical Note on Graduation for Family Planning and based on the findings discussed in this section, the evaluation team concludes that Nicaragua has achieved a successful graduation stage and that it is reasonable to expect that the provision of family planning (FP) services will be sustained in the future, that the Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) will be maintained at the level achieved prior to graduation and that inequities in access will not be increased. &nbsp;Overall, the implementation of USAID/Nicaragua's FPGS has been successful. &nbsp;USAID has achieved the main goals included in the strategy, and 15 of the 17 indicators defined by the FPGS have been met. &nbsp;The two unmet indicators, which are related to market segmentation and the participation of the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the social security in the market share, are in the process of being achieved. &nbsp;Through the implementation of the FPGS, USAID contributed to establishing a foundation for a solid, efficient and sustainable provision of family planning services in Nicaragua. &nbsp;It should also be noted that all recommendations presented in the mid-term evaluation of 2010 were implemented and monitored by the USAID health office, allowing adjustments to be made during implementation. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</span>",Inside title: USAID/Nicaragua family planning graduation strategy : final evaluacion report [sic],Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-524-O-12-00006,,10/1/2012 0:00,,Demographic surveys ~|~_©_~|~ Diseases ~|~_©_~|~ Health ~|~_©_~|~ Management ~|~_©_~|~ Marketing ~|~_©_~|~ USAID,Nicaragua,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU908.pdf,1190 KB,,,008584 - USAID.

PD-ACU-767,"In response to the financial crisis of 2008, the United States Government (USG) provided a stimulus package, known as the Financial Crisis Initiative (FCI), to complement actions by the Government of Tanzania (GoT) to stimulate the Tanzanian economy, increase food production, and provide social protection and safety nets to vulnerable groups.&nbsp; The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) contributed a total of $52.7 million over two phases to the FCI, intended as a rapid response to assist the rural poor affected by the financial crisis.&nbsp; Organizations already conducting similar programs in Tanzania were identified and their programs expanded to targeted vulnerable communities.&nbsp; The bulk of the USAID FCI support consisted of four safety net components implemented from 2009 to 2012 by the World Food Programme (WFP), the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and the United States Department of Interior (DOI).&nbsp; These four components included: (1) Food for Education (FFE) implemented by WFP to provide school meals to primary school students in coordination with the Ministry of Education and Vocational Training (MoEVT); (2) Food for Assets (FFA) implemented by WFP to enable community members to receive food while working on infrastructure construction projects to improve food production and/or access to markets (3)Cash for Work (C4W) implemented by WWF and DOI to provide temporary income while building infrastructure for communities in Wildlife Management Areas (WMA) that may have suffered from a reduction in tourism; and (4) Cash Transfer implemented by WFP to provide training on nutritional practices to mothers with young children along with a monthly cash transfer to enable these mothers to better feed their children.&nbsp; Deloitte's Leadership in Public Financial Management (LPFM) FCI Evaluation Team undertook a performance evaluation on behalf of USAID, focusing largely on the effectiveness and sustainability of the FCI.&nbsp; Performance measurement centers on whether a program has achieved its objectives, expressed as measurable performance standards.&nbsp; Key recommendations based on findings from each FCI component are included.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",'This publication was produced .... for the Tanzania Financial Crisis Initiative Performance Evaluation Task Order ....'

The C4J is a 19 million dollar fouryear project focused on sustaining and deepening reforms in the Indonesian justice sector to produce a less corrupt, a more accountable and more highly performing justice system. This goal will be achieved through more efficient, credible, and transparent functioning of the Supreme Court (Component 1) and the Attorney Generals Office (Component 2), including increasing the competence and integrity of judges, prosecutors and staff.

PD-ACU-713,"This is performance evaluation report of the Strengthening Human Rights in Kyrgyzstan program, implemented under a cooperative agreement between Freedom House and USAID/Kyrgyzstan that began in March 2010 and is presently scheduled to continue until late 2013.&nbsp; The agreement initially had a modest budget of $629,730 for a period of two years (March 201-February 2012), but it was more recently extended for an additional nineteen months (February 2012-September 2013) along with a budgetary increase of $800,000.&nbsp; The evaluation will be useful to: (1) USAID/Kyrgyzstan for strategic planning and program management and design; (2) to Freedom House for informing future programming; and (3) to the human rights development community for tracking developments in Kyrgyzstan.&nbsp; The evaluation is based on mixed-method, evidence-based research and included semistructured interviews with stakeholders, focus groups with average citizens in Kyrgyzstan, and an online survey of Freedom House training participants.&nbsp; The evaluators found mixed results regarding Freedom House's performance, both in its fulfillment of the existing cooperative agreement and its activities' potential to impact the current human rights situation in the country.&nbsp; While Freedom House has taken advantage of the opportunities to have substantial input on legislation and policies at the national level, it has had less impact, however, in other activities outlined in its original agreement.&nbsp; Freedom House has also not had much impact on the protection of human rights in the south over the last two years, which is one of the biggest problems facing human rights in the country today.&nbsp; The team determined that Freedom House's lack of impact was at least in part due to its lack of resources for programming as well as a result of a cooperative agreement designed before 2010, but implemented in a completely dif-ferent context.&nbsp; As a result, the program is not based on a clear theory of change appropriate to the present context and does not have a logical framework that links proposed impacts to the out-comes of planned activities.&nbsp; Despite these shortcomings, the team also found that Freedom House has made contributions to human rights in Kyrgyzstan.&nbsp; Freedom House continues to have significant potential to be influen-tial in the country given its generally positive reputation amongst human rights organizations and its perceived value as an internationally recognized protector of human rights.&nbsp; The evaluation report provides a variety of recommendations for how Freedom House can improve its impact during the remainder of its current program as well as a series of recommendations for USAID as it considers future interventions to consolidate the observation of human rights.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","""Submitted to: USAID/Kyrgyzstan"" ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Strengthening human rights in Kyrgyzstan",Special Evaluation,Documents,,,10/1/2012 0:00,,Human rights ~|~_©_~|~ Government reform ~|~_©_~|~ Local level ~|~_©_~|~ Law enforcement ~|~_©_~|~ Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Civil law ~|~_©_~|~ Reporting ~|~_©_~|~ Discrimination ~|~_©_~|~ Racial discrimination,Kyrgyzstan,116-A-00-10-00005-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-116-A-00-10-00005,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU713.pdf,1267 KB,"012295 - Democracy International, Inc.",,000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID),English,application/pdf,,,"Roberts, Sean ~|~_©_~|~ Salmorbekova, Zumrat",Human rights and social justice,Oct-12,,,,Strengthening human rights in Kyrgyzstan program evaluation,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTY2NzAy,Kyrgyzstan,,,2012-10-01,2012,KGZ,KGZ_2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PD-ACU-683,"The report begins with a brief review of the historical and contemporary context of the project in Angola. It then presents an historical overview of ProAgro, including a presentation of the primary goals and objectives of the program. These goals and objectives are then analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. This review is based on documentary data collected, and observations made, by the author during a three-week visit to the program in late April and early May 2012. The final two sections of the report present the reviewer's conclusions and recommendations related to the program. The emphasis in these concluding sections is on lessons learned from the six years of CLUSA's agricultural cooperative development experience that can be applied to future such projects especially related to coffee and bananas in Angola and also to similar agricultural cooperative development projects in other countries. ProAgro has been largely successful in carrying out a value chain project that has benefited over 6,000 farmers in Kwanza Sul, Benguela and Bengo provinces. It has set the stage for increases in production and marketing for the future through its development of 25 cooperatives, 12 co-op service centers, CESACOOPA ( a union of cooperatives in Kwanza Sul), and the proposed Cooperative Federation in Benguela. Both coffee and banana production now appear to be nearing a critical mass in which coordinated marketing through CESACOOPA, the planned Cooperative Federation in Benguela, and the co-ops have the potential to play major roles in increasing producer returns and continuing production and productivity.",Submitted as: ProAgro-Angola evaluation 2006-2012 (Avaliacao do ProAgro-Angola 2012) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Agricultural development and finance program (ADFP) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title also known as: ProAgro Angola ~|~_©_~|~ Portuguese ed.: PD-ACU-684,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,,,5/1/2012 0:00,,Agricultural development ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural management ~|~_©_~|~ Economic growth ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural cooperatives ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Farmers ~|~_©_~|~ Food production ~|~_©_~|~ Coffee ~|~_©_~|~ Bananas,Angola,690-A-00-06-00099-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-690-A-00-06-00099,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU683.pdf,1267 KB,,,008507 - USAID.

PD-ACU-680,"The Kosovo American Education Fund (KAEF) is a fellowship program for Kosovars that was established in 2004 from proceeds generated from the sale of the American Bank of Kosovo.&nbsp; The bank shares were held by the Kosovo Business Finance Fund (KBFF), established by USAID in 1999.&nbsp; The proceeds in the amount of US$7,881,825.25 formed the base of the grant agreement with the American Councils for International Education (AC) to establish the Kosovo American Education Fund.&nbsp; The goal of the KAEF is to provide Kosovar's with the education they need to lead Kosovo's economic development.&nbsp; Since its establishment, 51 Fellows have received KAEF support to attend masters programs in the U.S.&nbsp; The expectation was that income generated by the endowment would support at least ten Fellows annually.&nbsp; Additional resources that AC was expected to generate from other donors would enable AC to augment that number of Fellows.&nbsp; Because the ultimate objective of the effort was Kosovo's economic development, scholarships were limited to fields of study such as business, public administration, economics, international affairs, policy, and urban planning.&nbsp; This report presents the results of an evaluation of this program requested by the USAID Mission to Kosovo (USAID/K) and conducted in June and July, 2012.&nbsp; Conclusions reached by the evaluators are: (1) KAEF is a success with respect to producing degree graduates, although at a level somewhat lower than expected; and (2) KAEF has not performed as expected financially, and it will cease to exist if current financial trends continue.&nbsp; Recommendations include: (1) review KAEF's finances to determine what can reasonably be done to make KAEF's financial future more secure; (2) improve program analysis and reporting; (3) increase Kosovar involvement in decision-making and fundraising; (4) review options to increase the development impact since not all master's degrees -- not even all degrees in the currently accepted fields -- have the same development impact; (5) address the participation of women and minorities; (6) find ways to strengthen linkages Fellows host U.S. universities and other Fellows, to enhance follow-up activities in Kosovo; and (7) convince more Fellows to return to Kosovo since not returning reduces the program's impact.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","""It was prepared under Task Order AID-167-M-12-00001 under GEM II BPA AID-EDH-E-00-08-00003"" ~|~_©_~|~ Task order title: Global evaluation and monitoring II (GEM II)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-167-M-12-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-EDH-E-00-08-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ EDH-E-00-08-00003-00,,8/1/2012 0:00,,Educational development ~|~_©_~|~ Banks ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Income generation ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ School graduates ~|~_©_~|~ Masters degrees ~|~_©_~|~ Higher education ~|~_©_~|~ Girls education,Kosovo,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU680.pdf,674 KB,"013070 - JBS International, Inc.

PD-ACU-557,"This is a report on the summative evaluation of the Haiti Integrated Financing for Value Chains and Enterprises (HIFIVE) program funded by USAID/Haiti.&nbsp; HIFIVE is a financial sector service program designed to expand financial inclusion by increasing the availability of financial products and services to individual entrepreneurs and to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in targeted value chains in semi-urban and rural areas of Haiti.&nbsp; USAID/Haiti awarded HIFIVE in June 2009 as a 36 month (base period) cooperative agreement with two one-year extension options.&nbsp; In May 2102, USAID extended the project life for an additional two years, until May 31, 2014.&nbsp; The main objective of the evaluation was to review the effectiveness of the HIFIVE program as well as the sustainability and viability of its accomplishments to date.&nbsp; Of particular interest was to analyze the permanence of the changes that have occurred in the availability of finance for MSMEs, and in the financial services that are provided to them.&nbsp; In addition, the evaluation had to respond to three specific questions related to: (1) the effectiveness of the projects work to strengthen value chains and provide financial services to them; (2) the extent to which the project provided access to credit to the agricultural sector; and (3) the extent to which the interventions of the project have contributed to the viability of mobile banking in Haiti.&nbsp; Some of the findings the evaluators found are: (1) HIFIVE's work to provide value chain finance is highly effective; (2) the project-supported credit initiatives carried out by its financial partner institutions are sustainable; (3) HIFIVE's work to provide financial products for value chains is highly relevant; and (4) HIFIVE's work to provide value chain financing in rural and agricultural areas has great impact on the livelihood of micro- and small-scale borrowers.&nbsp; The evaluation report also contains additional findings, plus numerous conclusions and recommendations.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Cover title: Evaluation of the Haiti integrated financing for value chains and enterprises (HIFIVE) program ~|~_©_~|~ 'Prepared under RFTOP No. 521-12-00005 under the evaluation services IQC' ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Haiti integrated financing for value chains and enterprises (HIFIVE),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-RAN-I-00-09-00018 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00018-00,,8/1/2012 0:00,,Financing ~|~_©_~|~ Economic integration ~|~_©_~|~ Value chains ~|~_©_~|~ Business enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Rural areas ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Credit ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural economics ~|~_©_~|~ Banks,Haiti,521-A-00-09-00025-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU557.pdf,2246 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates,,"013413 - USAID.

PD-ACU-516,"<div>This report is a mid-term evaluation of the Increased Trust in Electoral Processes project (ITEP) in Georgia, a four year (2010-2014), $8.0 million project implemented by the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES) under the Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening (CEPPS) cooperative agreement. &nbsp;The project has four stated objectives, plus a small fifth objective recently added. &nbsp;This evaluation covers only the first two objectives: (1) improved capacity of election administration; and, (2) improved transparency of electoral processes through improved media coverage and CSO involvement. &nbsp;The intended end result or outcome for these objectives mirrors the project's title: increased trust in electoral processes. &nbsp;The evaluation focuses on electoral management bodies such as the Central Election Commission (CEC), the Voters' List Verification Commission (VLVC), the former Chamber of Control Group (CCG), now State Audit Office (SAO); and, to a more limited extent, the Inter-Agency Task Force on Free Elections (IATF), a non-beneficiary. &nbsp;In the non-governmental sector, the evaluation covers four civil society advocacy groups (CSOs) receiving assistance through ITEP. &nbsp;They are the International Society for Fair Elections and Democracy (ISFED), the Georgian Young Lawyers' Association (GYLA), Transparency International-Georgia (TI-G), and New Generation, New Initiative (nGnI). &nbsp;The findings in the report support the appropriateness of the project's design and the conclusion that the project is performing up to expectations, delivering timely, valued technical assistance through highquality field office staff and international consultants. &nbsp;The CEC and VLVC have increased capacity and have improved institutional performance. &nbsp;The SAO has improved its capacity, but it is implementing a political party and campaign finance law that does not meet minimum legal standards of due process and is having a &ldquo;chilling effect&rdquo; on freedom of association. &nbsp;The four CSOs that received sub-grants used the funding for well-targeted activities in support of election law reform, civic education outreach, and monitoring of public spending, thereby helping to increase electoral transparency. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</div>",Evaluated project title: Increased trust in electoral processes project (ITEP) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title also known as: Strengthening political competition in Georgia,Special Evaluation,Documents,,,10/1/2012 0:00,,Elections ~|~_©_~|~ Electoral systems ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Transparency ~|~_©_~|~ Communication media ~|~_©_~|~ Public awareness ~|~_©_~|~ Information dissemination,Georgia,AID-114-LA-10-00003,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU516.pdf,426 KB,"012295 - Democracy International, Inc.",,000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID),English,application/pdf,,,"Costello, Charles ~|~_©_~|~ Lippman, Harold ~|~_©_~|~ Jijelava, David",Elections,Oct-12,,,,Mid-term performance evaluation of the increased trust in electoral processes project (ITEP),,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTY1OTQ3,Georgia,,,2012-10-01,2012,GEO,GEO_2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PD-ACU-493,"Malaria continues to be a serious public health threat in Cambodia, exacerbated by the development of resistance to artemisinin combination therapy (ACT) by P. falciparum.&nbsp; It is estimated about 15% of the population are at risk with about 500,000 persons living in endemic areas of high malaria transmission.&nbsp; The National Malaria Control Program (NMCP) provides leadership to the malaria programs in Cambodia in close collaboration with both local and international partners.&nbsp; The Malaria Control in Cambodia Project (MCC) was a project of USAID/Regional Development Mission Asia managed by University Research Co. LLC (URC), with assistance from a subcontractor, Partners for Development (PfD).&nbsp; This four year project had a budget of US $3,550,000.&nbsp; Designed to enhance the NMCP activities, the MCC provided extensive technical assistance in addition to financial and in-kind support to the public health system to improve diagnosis and treatment.&nbsp; In addition, MCC educated the communities about malaria prevention, control and appropriate health seeking behaviors in five operational districts in four border provinces adjacent to Thailand: Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Oddar Meanchey and Pailin.&nbsp; The main purpose of this evaluation is to assess the performance of the MCC project and its impact.&nbsp; The evaluation is intended to provide insights and important feedback to each of the partners and stakeholders that should assist them to understand both the strengths and areas where technical, administrative and management efforts could be improved.&nbsp; It will also provide information for future malaria control programs and projects so they can learn from the MCC experience.&nbsp; The evaluation report includes key findings from an analysis of project design and implementation, genderal considerations, conclusions and recommendations.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",'This Report was produced at the request of the United States Agency for International Development/Regional Development Mission Asia (USAID/RDMA).' ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order: Malaria control in Cambodia (MCC) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Technical assistance and support contract 3 (TASC3),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,GHS-I-00-07-00010-00,,9/1/2012 0:00,,Malaria ~|~_©_~|~ Antimalarials ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Public health care ~|~_©_~|~ Disease diagnosis ~|~_©_~|~ Health behavior ~|~_©_~|~ Endemic diseases,Cambodia,GHS-I-00-07-00010-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU493.pdf,477 KB,,,011460 - USAID.

PD-ACU-496,"This report is the result of an evaluation of the results of a two-year (20102012) rule of law program implemented by Tetra Tech DPK Consulting, Inc. (DPK) under United States Agency for International Development (USAID).&nbsp; The program focused primarily on supporting the development of the formal judicial structure in Afghanistan.&nbsp; The overall goal of the program was to support USAID/Afghanistan's Rule of Law Strategy for Afghanistan, specifically Pillar 1 (improve the justice sector and reduce corruption) and Pillar 4 (build leadership in the justice sector and civil society).&nbsp; To support Pillar 1, the contractor attempted to develop the capacity of judiciary and the law schools; for Pillar 4, the contractor worked to raise public awareness and encourage citizens to resolve disputes through the formal justice sector.&nbsp; The program was divided into four components: (1) capacity building of the judiciary; (2) capacity building of court management systems; (3) capacity building of the faculties of law and Sharia; and (4) public legal outreach and awareness through strategic communication.&nbsp; Overall, the evaluators felt that the contractor was effective in reaching its programming goals when program beneficiaries bought into the program.&nbsp; When buy-in was not explicit, program results were mixed at best.&nbsp; During the evaluation, several issues emerged that affected DPK's ability to achieve its goals, including: (1) slow establishment of the program; (2) a lack of administrative agility; (3) fragile monitoring and evaluation systems; (3) USAID issuing the contract for one year, with a one-year option; (4) and security issues affecting how and when training could be conducted.&nbsp; All of these issues affected not only how much the project could achieve in the time available, but also how well the project could answer the ""so what"" questions about the value of its efforts.&nbsp; Going forward, emphasis should be placed on programs that focus on Afghan youth, as this group demonstrated enthusiasm for participating in and implementing the lessons learned from the program.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Title in footer: RLS-F program evaluation final report ~|~_©_~|~ Task order no.

The objectives of MNBSP are: (1) to enable the academically qualified, yet financially needy, Pakistani students to continue university studies in selected private and public universities of Pakistan in the fields of agriculture and business administration; and (2) to enhance the institutional capacity of the HEC of the GOP and local public and private sector universities in designing and implementing need and merit based scholarship projects.&nbsp; The purpose of this evaluation of MNBSP is to provide USAID/Pakistan with an independent performance-cum-process evaluation to help improve the performance of MNBSP and its contribution to USAID/Pakistan's development objectives.&nbsp; The scope of the evaluation was defined through twelve specific questions.&nbsp; After review, the evaluators make five key recommendations: (1) in consultation with HEC, reconsider the fields of study and the allocation of scholarships across supported fields of study in future scholarship programs; (2) increase outreach to women; (3) consider modifying eligibility criteria for women with a more robust definition of ""remote/vulnerable""; (4) identify and resolve causes of delayed payments to recipients; and (5) ensure that the scholarship covers all education expenses of the students.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",'Contracted Under No. GS-23F-8012H and Order No. AID-391-M-11-00001' ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Merit and needs-based scholarship program (MNBSP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Independent monitoring and evaluation contract (IMEC),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-391-M-11-00001,,8/1/2012 0:00,,Scholarships ~|~_©_~|~ Higher education ~|~_©_~|~ Educational development,Pakistan,391-G-00-04-01023-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU395.pdf,3297 KB,"003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

PD-ACU-382,"<span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"">In India, the urban poor are among the fastest growing and especially vulnerable sub-populations, having limited access to clean water, sanitation, and health care. &nbsp;Despite compelling need, urban health has not been a priority issue and receives less attention than rural health care. &nbsp;In response to the Government of India's proposed National Urban Health Mission (NUHM), USAID's Health of the Urban Poor (HUP) project in 2009 was designed to work at state, municipal, and community levels to develop innovative policies and program strategies to better meet the health needs of the urban poor. &nbsp;This mid-term HUP evaluation was designed to provide an assessment of the project's progress in addressing five key components (i.e., technical assistance (TA), public private partnerships, convergence, demonstration models, and management and governance) after one year of project implementation. &nbsp;The evaluation addresses the extent to which HUP is developing and implementing innovative urban health interventions and models that can be considered for replication and scale up, in India and possibly other countries as well. &nbsp;The evaluation's goal is to provide useful guidance on how well the project has been rolled-out, what appears to be working or not working, and how HUP might be best deployed to ensure positive results during the remainder of the project. &nbsp;The evaluation was conducted over a period of four weeks during June and July 2012. &nbsp;The evaluators found that the HUP project has several accomplishments and achievements, despite encountering many challenges which include: on-going delay in the launch of the NUHM and thus, no clear incentive for states to address urban health issues; a 10-month delay in HUP project approval by GOI, resulting in a very short period (six to 12 months) for implementation of project activities to date; and uncertainty about the remaining time period (one or two years) until project completion. &nbsp;Another fundamental challenge is the nature of the project design, which includes a broad range of activities to be provided through a TA approach in eight states and five municipalities representing diverse environments. &nbsp;Also, the project's performance indicators make it difficult to assess achievements in many areas. &nbsp;However, in a relatively short period, the HUP project has helped to delineate national- and state-level policies on urban health, in addition to broadening the participation of relevant stakeholders in the development of NUHM policies, program priorities, and operational strategies (e.g., national- and state-level ministries and departments). &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</span>",Submitted as: Final HUP midterm evaluation report ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Health of the urban poor  (HUP),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-386-TO-10-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00019 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00019-00,,10/1/2012 0:00,,Urban populations ~|~_©_~|~ Poor ~|~_©_~|~ Health delivery ~|~_©_~|~ Water sanitation ~|~_©_~|~ Local level ~|~_©_~|~ Municipal level,India,386-A-00-09-00305-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-386-A-00-09-00305,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU382.pdf,1165 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID),English,application/pdf,Performance evaluation (2011 definition) ~|~_©_~|~ Interim evaluation,,"Justice, Judith ~|~_©_~|~ Gopinath, Ranjani ~|~_©_~|~ et al.",Health delivery,Oct-12,,,,USAID/India health of the urban poor : mid-term evaluation report,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTY1MDY2,India,,,2012-10-01,2012,IND,IND_2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PD-ACU-379,"<span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"">The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) provided technical assistance to the National Tuberculosis Control Program of Mexico based on a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed in 1999 by Presidents Bill Clinton and Ernesto Zedillo and a strategic objective grant agreement (SOAG) in 2000. &nbsp;The strategic objective was to develop a sustainable and effective institutional capacity to diagnose, control, and monitor tuberculosis in target areas. &nbsp;USAID's commitment was approximately US$16 million; support started in 2004 and ended in 2012. &nbsp;The project aimed to increase political commitment to the TB program, increase use of laboratory-based diagnosis, improve directly observed therapy, and strengthen mechanisms to monitor program activities to reach 70 percent TB case detection and 85 percent cure rate. &nbsp;This evaluation aims to: (1) update the findings and recommendations from the 2010 evaluation of activities by USAID and the Tuberculosis Coalition for Technical Assistance (TBCTA); (2) document USAID's legacy in Mexico for TB control; (3) assess the sustainability of USAID investments in Mexico for TB; (4) identify priority activities at risk of not being continued after the phase-out of USAID support; and (5) recommend options for ensuring sustainability. &nbsp;The document also analyzes the past and current epidemiological situation of tuberculosis in Mexico and includes recommendations to USAID and to the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) for future action to sustain gains and increase the impact of control activities on TB transmission, incidence, and mortality. &nbsp;The evaluators concluded that USAID cooperation had a major impact on the national capacity for TB control, disproportionate to the funds invested (~US$0.01 per capita per year). &nbsp;The main areas strengthened were: (1) the laboratory network; (2) human resource capacity at national, state, and district level; (3) the information system; (4) and MDR-TB diagnosis and case management. &nbsp;Technical cooperation accelerated DOTS implementation and increased political commitment at national level and in geographical areas in addition to the priority states. &nbsp;There were increased treatment success rates, and the strategic objectives of case detection and treatment success were achieved. &nbsp;In areas with direct support to service improvement, PP/PPM and ACSM, the detection of suspects and notification of smear-positive pulmonary TB cases increased rapidly. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</span>","""This document was prepared .... under the Tuberculosis Indefinite Quantity Contract (TB IQC) Task Order 01 (TO2015), GHN-I-00-09-00006-01."" ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Tuberculosis indefinite quantity contract (TB IQC)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,GHN-I-01-09-00006-00 ~|~_©_~|~ GHN-I-00-09-00006-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GHN-I-01-09-00006 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GHN-I-00-09-00006,,10/1/2012 0:00,,Tuberculosis ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Disease transmission ~|~_©_~|~ Mortality ~|~_©_~|~ Multidrug-resistant/extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/XDR-TB) ~|~_©_~|~ Community mobilization,Mexico,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU379.pdf,1037 KB,006425 - Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH),,"011222 - USAID.

PD-ACU-369,"This report presents the results of an evaluation of the performance of the West Africa Trade Hub (the Trade Hub), which focuses on export-ready companies, and two regional trade projects the Agribusiness and Trade Promotion Project (ATP) and the Extended-ATP (E-ATP), which focus on promoting regional trade within West Africa for value chains including grains, cattle, poultry, and onions. When discussing the latter projects in this report, they are collectively referred to as E/ATP, and all three projects conducted a tremendous amount of training and capacity building to build commodity associations and help individual companies and producer organizations improve their performance and exports. The challenges addressed, such as nontariff barriers to free trade in Africa, transport impediments, the severe shortage of credit for agribusiness, and marketing and policy issues were substantial and the projects undertook short-term and medium-term activities that met those challenges and in the process built capacity for the future and expanded trade.The Trade Hub, under the current evaluation period (2007-2011) achieved a number of successes, directly facilitating $178 million of private sector exports by small companies for non-traditional exports to America and Europe. E/ATP launched in 2009, specifically dealt with very small producers and their production and marketing organizations achieving success in expanding marketing information and contacts, introducing technological improvements, and building capacity in key producer and trader organizations, in a short time frame. Regional trade registered in these commodities by the trade monitoring system that E/ATP set up reached $392 million in 2009/10 including cattle ($293 million), onions ($44 million), maize ($15 million), sorghum ($13.4 million), millet ($12.9 million), parboiled rice ($7.7 million), and poultry day-old chicks ($6.8 million).",Title in footer: West African trade-related evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: West African trade hub (WATH) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Agribusiness and trade promotion (ATP) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Expanded agribusiness and trade promotion (E-ATP) ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00015-00,Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-624-TO-11-0001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-09-00015 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00015-00,,5/1/2012 0:00,,Regional trade ~|~_©_~|~ Value chains ~|~_©_~|~ Bread grains ~|~_©_~|~ Cattle ~|~_©_~|~ Poultry ~|~_©_~|~ Onions ~|~_©_~|~ Agribusiness ~|~_©_~|~ Exports ~|~_©_~|~ Free trade ~|~_©_~|~ Access to credit ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural products ~|~_©_~|~ Export promotion ~|~_©_~|~ Transportation ~|~_©_~|~ Market development ~|~_©_~|~ Finance,West Africa,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU369.pdf,1991 KB,"011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

PD-ACU-357,"The purpose of the USAID/South Africa (SA) Umbrella Grant Management (UGM) evaluation was to inform the design of the next UGM. The evaluation focused on strengths and weaknesses of three bilateral UGM partners (or UGMPs): FHI360, Pact, and Right to Care. It also focused on a fourth project (the FHI360 Capable Partners project) in a variety of domains. FHI360 Capable Partners, or CAP, was not a UGM, but rather a Leader with Associate Award under a global award. Therefore, throughout the report, UGMPs is used to refer to the first three UGMPs, and CAP is addressed separately, due to its different aims, methodologies and funding mechanism. The evaluation teams overall observation, based on documentation and interviews with UGM and USAID, is that all three UGMPs ensured compliance and accountability for US funds. There were few instances of noncompliance or nonperformance by the SPs managed by the UGMPs; in these limited cases, the evidence seen suggests that the UGMPs discovered the issues quickly and took prompt action. The SI team observed that minor flaws in financial management, governance, or leadership, if not addressed rapidly and pro-actively, have the potential to escalate to major flaws.",,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,,,5/1/2012 0:00,,Grants ~|~_©_~|~ HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Development program management ~|~_©_~|~ Child feeding programs ~|~_©_~|~ Nutrition improvement,South Africa,674-A-00-08-00001-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 674-A-00-08-00002-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 674-A-00-08-00003-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 674-A-00-09-00001-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-674-A-00-08-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-674-A-00-08-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-674-A-00-08-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-674-A-00-09-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU357.pdf,1656 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID),English,application/pdf,Performance evaluation (2011 definition),,,HIV / AIDS,May-12,,,,South Africa umbrella grants management (UGM) performance evaluation,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTY0OTkz,,,,2012-05-01,2012,ZAF,ZAF_2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PD-ACU-305,"Phase II of the Pastoral Livelihoods Initiative (PLI II) is a four-year project, begun in May 2009, whose objective is to improve and strengthen the lives and livelihoods of approximately 205,000 pastoralists and ex-pastoralists living in 15 woredas (districts) in lowlands areas of Ethiopia's Oromia, Somali, and Afar Regional States.&nbsp; This million dollar project is being implemented under a cooperative agreement by a consortium led by Save the Children U.S.' PLI IIs interventions include: (1) improving community-based natural resource management; (2) improving the ability of pastoralists to gain more economic value from their livestock; (3) diversifying their ability to generate income; (4) improving the effectiveness of early warning systems; and (5) implementing selected MNCH and PEPFAR wrap-around interventions.&nbsp; PLI II makes use of crisis modifiers [(CM, specific interventions such as destocking of livestock) to improve the ability to provide food and water to people and animals during drought.&nbsp; Each consortium member is responsible for implementing a range of interventions in assigned woredas.&nbsp; In March 2012 USAID/Ethiopia contracted for an evaluation of the progress of PLI II towards achieving its goals and to make recommendations for consideration during the final year of the project.&nbsp; The main evaluation questions were: (1) how effective is the project in achieving set objectives and anticipated results; (2) how is the project's approach and methodology designed to achieve project objectives?; and (3) how effective is PLI II's management structure, consortium relationships and staff composition? The findings of this evaluation are based primarily on the evidence-based observations and interviews/focus groups that the members of the evaluation team conducted during their time in-country informed by review of program reports.&nbsp; As a result of these findings, numerous recommendations are also included in the report.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Evaluated project title: Pastoralist livelihoods initiative II (PLI II),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-663-TO-12-00005 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00016-00 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00016-00,,8/1/2012 0:00,,Livelihood ~|~_©_~|~ Lowland cropping ~|~_©_~|~ Natural resource management ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Income generation ~|~_©_~|~ Livestock ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural diversification ~|~_©_~|~ Early warning systems ~|~_©_~|~ Drought resistance ~|~_©_~|~ Drought,Ethiopia,663-A-00-09-00413-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-663-A-00-09-00413,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU305.pdf,1822 KB,"001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

PD-ACU-298,"Akazi Kanoze (Work Well Done) is a five-year, $9.8 million youth workforce development project designed specifically to help Rwandan youth develop the skills and attitudes necessary to obtain sustainable livelihoods, maintain healthy lifestyles, and participate constructively in their communities through a combination of education, training, and support services. More specifically, it couples a Work Readiness Curriculum designed to build the soft skills required by youth to succeed in the careers they are preparing as they complete skills training programs offered by various youth-serving organizations. Akazi Kanoze is financed by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC).The project also seeks to build the capacity of organizations promoting youth workforce development and contribute to emerging Government of Rwanda (GoR) policy implementation in this area. The project design includes linking youth to existing jobs, training, and education opportunities where possible. Nurturing formal and informal collaborative alliances between USG, local government institutions, other donors, NGOs, education and training providers, and the private sector are also part of the project design. This evaluation explores the relevant data available to inform USAID/Rwanda on the impact of the Akazi Kanoze program in relation to the following four objectives: (1)Identify evidence of increased youth access to employment; (2)Identify evidence of increased capacity of local NGOs to serve youth needs for non-formal Work Readiness and job skills training; (3)Identify key components of the Akazi Kanoze model that may affect program success; (4)Assess how well the Akazi Kanoze project is meeting its goal and key objectives cost-effectively.",Project title: Akazi kanoze youth livelihoods,Special Evaluation,Documents,696-A-00-09-00002-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-696-A-00-09-00002,,4/1/2012 0:00,,Youth ~|~_©_~|~ Livelihood ~|~_©_~|~ Labor force ~|~_©_~|~ Health behavior ~|~_©_~|~ Skilled workers ~|~_©_~|~ Life skills training ~|~_©_~|~ Professional training ~|~_©_~|~ Occupational opportunities ~|~_©_~|~ Employment ~|~_©_~|~ Access to information,Rwanda,696-A-00-09-00002-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-696-A-00-09-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU298.pdf,660 KB,"000461 - Education Development Center, Inc.

The Program was implemented by the International Republican Institute (IRI) and the National Democratic Institute (NDI) from 2007 to 2012. This evaluation examines implementing partners activities, evaluates their results, identifies lessons learned and best practices, and develops recommendations for possible future USAID support. The Elections and Political Processes program has been successful in many respects. Colombian partners and beneficiaries acknowledge the value of working with NDI and IRI and the importance of partnering with them to advance their interests. NDI and IRI were recognized by a vast majority of interviewees as critical players in Colombia, as unlike local organizations, these international Institutes achieved unparalleled convening power, and managed to reach agreements among often seemingly irreconcilable organizations and/or leaders on a range of issues.

PD-ACU-206,"According to its logical framework, the purpose of the MDP is to increase the accountability of municipal governments to the communities they serve and to achieve broad community participation in decisionmaking and oversight of local public investments. However, the performance of the program was not uniform in all municipalities. The sensitive political setting in Cabinda and the difficult socio-economic conditions in Cuito Cuanavale influenced on the relatively weaker performance of these municipalities in some outputs. One of the insights stemming from this is that, due to the approach adopted that privileged the adoption of a model that could be used for all municipalities, the program might have overlooked the different contexts where it operated, applying a standardized approach in all components for all cases. Whilst the alternative of applying different policy models for different municipalities cannot be considered realistic, finding ways to address the specificities of the municipalities in a diverse country like Angola is important to ensure the relevance and effectiveness of governance interventions like the MDP.",Evaluated project title: Municipal development program (MDP) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project also known as: Municipal development program-Angola (MDP-Angola) ~|~_©_~|~ Mid-term evaluation: PD-ACT-367,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,,,3/1/2012 0:00,,Municipal level ~|~_©_~|~ Political development ~|~_©_~|~ Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Community development ~|~_©_~|~ Political participation ~|~_©_~|~ Governance,Angola,690-A-00-06-00067-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-690-A-00-06-00067-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU206.pdf,1001 KB,,,008507 - USAID.

PD-ACU-123,"The Democratic Indicators Monitoring Survey (DIMS) cooperative agreement (CA), signed between USAID and the Latin American Public Opinion Project (LAPOP), is an eight-year agreement including several components.&nbsp; The largest component of the agreement is a series of nationally-representative public opinion surveys that have been conducted biennially since 2006 in 16 Central American, South American, and Caribbean countries.&nbsp; Other components of the agreement include survey oversamples in DIMS countries, a range of reporting and dissemination activities, and special studies, most notably including the Central American Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) impact evaluation (IE).&nbsp; The DIMS surveys are a part of the broader AmericasBarometer (AB) project conducted by LAPOP, a research institute at Vanderbilt University.&nbsp; The DIMS public opinion surveys are designed to measure citizen perceptions of and experiences with several aspects of governance and democracy.&nbsp; Their purpose is to: (1) track longitudinal changes in democratization in each country individually as well as the region as a whole; (2) support USAID strategic planning at both Mission and Bureau levels; (3) allow USAID to make cross-national comparisons and develop common indicators of progress; and (4) assess the outcomes of USAID's democracy programming.&nbsp; A rigorous performance evaluation was conducted of the public opinion survey component of the DIMS agreement.&nbsp; The overall purpose of the evaluation was to assess the performance of DIMS and to advise USAID on ways to strengthen the design and implementation of a possible new iteration of the DIMS cooperative agreement.&nbsp; Some of the findings evaluators found include: (1) DIMS has provided an abundance of high quality data to USAID/Washington (USAID/W), USAID country Missions, host governments, NGOs, media and researchers; (2) DIMS methodology adheres to the highest professional standards; (3) the DIMS questionnaire is carefully constructed, with a core time-series of standard questions across countries combined with country-specific and special topic questions; (4) surveys are used by USAID both in the LAC Bureau and in individual country missions, but only somewhat by host country governments and other in-country users; (5) the survey process has increased the survey capabilities of individuals and firms throughout Latin America; and (6) LAPOP has extensive female participation in staff at Vanderbilt, but less at its partners and contractors.&nbsp; The evaluators also provide numerous recommendations in the report.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Evaluated project title: Democratic indicators monitoring survey (DIMS) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Democracy and governance analytical services III,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-TO-11-00057 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-10-00003,,8/1/2012 0:00,,Democratization ~|~_©_~|~ Performance indicators ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Rule of law ~|~_©_~|~ Human rights ~|~_©_~|~ Social values ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Political development ~|~_©_~|~ Gender rights ~|~_©_~|~ Local level ~|~_©_~|~ Local capacity building,South America ~|~_©_~|~ Caribbean ~|~_©_~|~ Central America,598-A-00-06-00061-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU123.pdf,6828 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,"040194 - USAID.

PD-ACT-997,"<span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"">This performance evaluation presents documented findings that the USAID/DR-funded Dominican Sustainable Tourism Alliance (DSTA) program is making progress if somewhat delayed progress toward reaching its goal of better equipping local small, medium-sized and community-based tourism enterprises and organizations. This outcome is most notable in the nine existing tourism clusters created with USAID support under its earlier Competitiveness and Policy Project (CPP) which offers an alternative vision for sustainable tourism in the Dominican Republic (DR).Further, the evaluation concludes from these findings that the DSTA programs five-component strategy was soundly designed if at times unevenly executed for implementing a cluster approach to developing sustainable community-based organizations and micro, small and medium enterprises that can compete effectively in marketing tourism products and services, including the niche market of eco-tourism. This cluster approach has made noteworthy, if occasionally halting, progress toward achieving the DSTAs five-year life of program targets and is worthy of examination and consideration for replication in other development settings. Still, some design and implementation flaws have emerged, as has been recognized and largely addressed by USAID and DSTA implementing partners during the initial three years of Program execution. </span>",Task order no:  AID-517-TO-11-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Dominican Sustainable Tourism Alliance (DSTA) ~|~_©_~|~ V. 1: PD-ACT-994 ~|~_©_~|~ V. 2: PD-ACT-996 ~|~_©_~|~ Integrated evaluation report: PD-ACT-999,Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-517-TO-11-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00008 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00008-00,,9/1/2011 0:00,,Tourist industry ~|~_©_~|~ Small scale enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Medium scale enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Community based delivery ~|~_©_~|~ Community participation,Dominican Republic,517-A-00-07-00105-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-517-A-00-07-00105,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT997.pdf,2038 KB,"006007 - AMEX International, Inc.",,"013413 - USAID.

PD-ACT-906,"Troubled relations between Armenia and Turkey have had a negative influence on Armenia since independence. Armenia and Turkey are neighbors that share hundreds of years of history of living together - as well as the last century of tensions. The border has been closed by Turkey for most of the 20 years of Armenian independence and the two countries have not established diplomatic relations. However, from a 10 year perspective there have been dramatic changes in Armenia-Turkey rapprochement - from almost no contact to significant civil society and business ties. Improved Armenia-Turkey relations are important to the United States Government in its efforts to support peace and stability in the Caucasus and the development of a strong democratic Armenia with economic and other engagement with her neighbors. But conditions are not propitious for a breakthrough in the status quo because there are few opportunities for a significant change in state-to-state relations. USAID thus needs a medium- to long-term perspective to support future rapprochement, as well as to provide support to keep the ideas and vision of Armenia-Turkey rapprochement alive and to build on growing concrete ties in civil society and businesses.",Also known as: SATR evaluation report ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Armenia-Turkey rapprochement (SATR),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-111-TO-11-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00016 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00016-00,,2/1/2012 0:00,,International conflict ~|~_©_~|~ International monetary relations ~|~_©_~|~ Business formation ~|~_©_~|~ Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Partnerships ~|~_©_~|~ Multilateral relations,Armenia ~|~_©_~|~ Turkey,AID-111-A-10-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT906.pdf,982 KB,"001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

The evaluation was conducted by International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc. (IBTCI) as per the terms of the Russia Monitoring and Evaluation Program (RMEP) and based on the Notification of Performance Evaluation #11 sent to IBTCI on December 30, 2011.The core activities of the USAID/Russia Maternal and Child Health Project are: 1)Improving Care for Mothers and Babies(ICMB) implemented by University Research Co. (URC); and 2)Institutionalizing Best Practices in Maternal and Child Health (IBPMCH) implemented by John Snow Inc. (JSI) and the Institute for Family Health (IFH).MCHP aimed to reduce maternal and infant mortality; increase the use of modern contraceptives; and decrease abortion rates in selected regions across Russia. These objectives were achieved through training and technical assistance to healthcare providers; disseminating best practices of care during pregnancy, delivery and infanthood to local and regional health care facilities; and, institutionalizing these best practices in appropriate Russian institutions at the federal and okrug levels.","'Contracted under RAN-I-00-09-00016-00, Order No. AID-118-TO-11-00004' ~|~_©_~|~ Cover title: Final performance evaluation : USAID maternal and child health project : evaluation report ~|~_©_~|~ Title in header: Russia monitoring and evaluation project -- MCHP evaluation report ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order title: Improving care for mothers and babies (ICMB) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order title: Institutionalizing best practices in maternal and child health (IBPMCH) (IBP-MCH) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Russia monitoring and evaluation project (RMEP) ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-09-00016",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-118-TO-11-00004 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00016 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00016-00,,6/1/2012 0:00,,Maternal child health care ~|~_©_~|~ Mothers ~|~_©_~|~ Safe motherhood ~|~_©_~|~ Postnatal nutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Post partum care ~|~_©_~|~ Infant mortality ~|~_©_~|~ Health facilities,Russia,GHN-I-01-07-00003-00 ~|~_©_~|~ GHN-I-00-07-00003-00 ~|~_©_~|~ GHS-I-04-07-00002-00 ~|~_©_~|~ GHS-I-00-07-00002-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GHN-I-01-07-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GHN-I-00-07-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GHS-I-04-07-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GHS-I-00-07-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT905.pdf,2292 KB,"International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

PD-ACT-903,"The Accelerating Sustainable Agriculture Program (ASAP) followed other USAID funded agriculture development programs with similar objectives. The intent was to continue moving agriculture along the spectrum from the farm gate to higher levels within the processing sector, with the end goal of increasing exports as an engine for development. The project ended in October 2011 with interest in an evaluation two-fold: assess the performance and reach of the activities implemented under ASAP and pose lessons learned that might impact future program considerations along this farm gate to export continuum. The evaluation process considered the four focus areas of the project: agribusiness investments, agriculture inputs, agriculture services provided to the sector, and advisory services provided to the ministry, which formed the basis for addressing the questions posed in the Statement of Work. ASAP achieved much success, pointing the way to better post harvest quality products and moving traders and exporters to higher levels of performance. Strides were made in providing services and better technologies down to the farm gate. Follow-up and coordination were ongoing issues through the life of the project.","""The report was contracted under: USAID Contract Number: GS-10F-0425M, Order Number: 306-M-00-07-00502-00, Task Order Number 2007-012"" ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Accelerating sustainable agriculture program (ASAP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Services under program and project offices for results tracking (SUPPORT)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,306-M-00-07-00502-00,,4/1/2012 0:00,,Agricultural development ~|~_©_~|~ Sustainable agriculture ~|~_©_~|~ Accelerated education ~|~_©_~|~ Exports ~|~_©_~|~ Agribusiness ~|~_©_~|~ Investment,Afghanistan,306-C-00-07-00501-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-306-C-00-07-00501,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT903.pdf,3828 KB,"000356 - Checchi and Co.

PD-ACT-900,"The District Delivery Program (DDP) was conceived in late 2009 as a means to quickly begin providing basic public services in areas recently cleared by the military and, through greater presence and visibility, help strengthen the credibility of the government so the population would stop supporting insurgents. The purpose of this evaluation was to assess program performance in the 13 Districts that had been approved for USAID funding including identifying program delivery obstacles, achievement of objectives and benchmarks, and to recommend a way forward.Despite its short duration and negligible disbursements, DDP has been a rich learning experience. It highlighted major shortcomings in DDPs design and implementation. With respect to design flaws, the dual objectives of the program were valid but did not fit together well - one aimed at short-term quick impact and other longer-term institutional strengthening. The program is considered an anomaly as it was an on-budget stabilization initiative with TA provided through USG field representatives. Regarding implementation, the pressure for a quick roll-out, without other benefits of piloting and testing, contributed to problems based on inaccurate assumptions of GIRoAs financial and staffing capability. IDLG requires considerable support at the central, provincial and district levels to operate effectively. Program management by USG was deficient in many respects, and there was much room for improvement in the technical assistance provided at the provincial and central levels where support was needed most. USG field staff had mixed capabilities and failed to receive adequate management support.","""The performance evaluation was contracted under: USAID Contract Number: GS-10F-0425M, Order Number: 306-M-00-07-00502-00, Task Order Number 2007-012"" ~|~_©_~|~ Also known as: Performance evaluation of district delivery program ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: District delivery program (DDP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Services under program and project offices for results tracking (SUPPORT)",Special Evaluation,Documents,306-M-00-07-00502-00,,4/1/2012 0:00,,Government planning ~|~_©_~|~ Government reform ~|~_©_~|~ Districts ~|~_©_~|~ Political stability ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Political corruption ~|~_©_~|~ Anticorruption interventions,Afghanistan,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT900.pdf,2092 KB,"000356 - Checchi and Co.

PD-ACT-898,"Since 2006, a series of microfinance and cooperative institutions funded by USAID have been successful in delivering credit to individuals and businesses. One of these activities, the network of Islamic Investment and Financial Cooperatives (IIFCs), under the USAID funded Agriculture, Rural Investment and Enterprise Strengthening project (ARIES), was successful in delivering credit to rural and small urban centers, primarily in the North. These memberowned and managed financial cooperatives offer Sharia-compliant credit services to rural farm households and rural/urban small businesses to support improvements in their economic livelihoods and encourage savings for future household and economic activities.

PD-ACT-895,"he purpose of this evaluation is to identify results and lessons learned from USAIDs Afghanistan Media Development and Empowerment Project (AMDEP). AMDEP was designed as a one-year project (later extended) that began on November 1, 2010. It built on eight years of previous USAID media activities in Afghanistan and continued USAIDs strategic focus on improving news and development-related radio information for underserved groups such as rural families, women and young people. AMDEP supports a comprehensive value chain approach to strengthening the media sector, dealing with training of journalists; establishing and operating a network of rural radio stations; introducing new media to enable amateur voices to communicate about social, economic, and development issues; encouraging advocacy to protect journalistic freedoms; helping citizens understand and value the importance of media information and news; training media lawyers; and supporting new media laws and policies that will support development of a dynamic, independent media industry. Internews is the lead implementer of AMDEP activities and of previous USAID media activities that led to AMDEP. Overall, AMDEP has been remarkably successful. It had to function in a context of administrative delays and funding uncertainties, security threats, an environment of many different media projects and an unpredictable economy. The technical and managerial depth of the Internews team was an important factor in the projects success, as was its selection of effective Afghan partner organizations. Flexibility and agility on the part of USAID and Internews made it possible to adapt to changing circumstances.",''Contracted under USAID Contract Number: GS-10F-0425M (Order Number: 306-M-00-07-00502-00) (Task Order Number 2007-012)'' ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Afghanistan media development and empowerment project (AMDEP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Services under program and project offices for results tracking (SUPPORT),Special Evaluation,Documents,306-M-00-07-00502-00,,4/1/2012 0:00,,Communication media ~|~_©_~|~ Communications development ~|~_©_~|~ Radio ~|~_©_~|~ Rural populations ~|~_©_~|~ Youth ~|~_©_~|~ Broadcasts ~|~_©_~|~ Information dissemination,Afghanistan,306-A-00-10-00533-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-306-A-00-10-00533,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT895.pdf,2132 KB,"000356 - Checchi and Co.

PD-ACT-869,"The AIDS Prevention and Control Project (APAC), a unique public private partnership, has been described as USAID/Indias HIV/AIDS flagship project. Operating in the southern state of Tamil Nadu from 19952012 with a budget of $47.25 million, it has provided direct HIV-prevention services through local nongovernmental organizations (NGO) and technical assistance to both the Tamil Nadu State AIDS Control Society (TANSACS) and the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO). This evaluation provides a rigorous analysis of APACs impact on health outcomes in Tamil Nadu and of the elements contributing to APACs successful reputation. This report provides contextual information about HIV/AIDS in India and Tamil Nadu and describes APACs three phases. Evaluation methodology is followed by findings in three key areas of inquiry: (1) the NGO-government partnership model; (2) health outcomes; and (3) technical assistance. The report then offers the teams conclusions and identifies factors that contributed to the findings. Finally, the report offers recommendations for future HIV/AIDS and health systems strengthening (HSS) programming to USAID as well as to NACO and TANSACS, as both remain active partners in APAC.",Evaluated project title: AIDS prevention and control (APAC),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,RAN-I-00-09-00019-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00019,,4/1/2012 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Health care systems ~|~_©_~|~ Information management ~|~_©_~|~ Local level ~|~_©_~|~ Public health care,India,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT869.pdf,2432 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,"013413 - USAID.

PD-ACT-791,"In April 2012, USAID's Office of Population and Reproductive Health, requested a learning evaluation of knowledge management (KM) and social media for health, focusing on the work and role of the Knowledge for Health (K4Health) project, run by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health Center for Communication Programs (JHU-CCP) and supported by FHI360 and MSH.&nbsp; The external evaluation's main questions were: (1) what state-of-the-art social media and social networking practices (including Web 2.0) do K4Health and other companies and organizations use to reach audiences in the developing world?; (2) what role has K4Health played as a KM leader?; (3) what recommendations would K4Health and other companies and organizations offer for the future use of social media and social networking as part of an overall KM strategy?; and (4) what intangible assets does K4Health offer regarding social media and KM? The evaluators reviewed K4Healths documents and other associated documents and websites.&nbsp; Forty individuals representing the K4Health team, USAID (Washington and field), members of the implementing partner community, and other development organizations were interviewed.&nbsp; With social media aspect evaluators findings include: (1) K4Health both develops and participates in a variety of active and useful communities of practice (COP); (2) the K4Health team has taken a leadership position in developing good uses of social media for family planning and reproductive health; (3) the team stays abreast of social media trends, but evaluates and tests before embracing the latest sites.&nbsp; With KM, the evaluators found, overall, interviewees had strong positive feelings about the work of K4Health in KM generally and as a KM leader.&nbsp; Several interviewees mentioned that they considered the modeling of internal and external KM practices as a key element of KM leadership.&nbsp; Since some time has passed since the start of the project, the recommendation is that the project share its internal KM experiences.&nbsp; The evaluation also found that older information technology has caused some limitations both in dealing with the inevitable obsolescence of platforms and responding to emerging technology changes.&nbsp; Decisions about which platform to use and when to move to a new system need to be more responsive to the changing nature of the technology.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Evaluated project title: Knowledge for health (K4Health) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health technical assistance bridge (GH tech bridge),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-C-12-00004,,6/1/2012 0:00,,Knowledge management (KM) ~|~_©_~|~ Educational media ~|~_©_~|~ Information dissemination ~|~_©_~|~ Community leadership ~|~_©_~|~ Social impact,Iran,GPO-A-00-08-00006-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GPO-A-00-08-00006,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT791.pdf,646 KB,"011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

PD-ACT-792,"In November 2008, USAID awarded IntraHealth International a bilateral Cooperative Agreement, for five years and nearly USD $50 million. The stated goal of the project was to build the capacity of indigenous organizations to respond to and implement HIV/AIDS programs leading to increased numbers of Namibians who know their HIV status, and to improved access to high quality HIV/AIDS prevention, care, and support and treatment services.IntraHealth was to work primarily with FBOs, other non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the MoHSS in pursuit of these objectives, emphasizing building the capacity and availability of managers and staff within the FBO health care and MoHSS systems through training and TA to clinical and administrative personnel, and development of e-data systems for management of patients records, human resources and project data. Work was focused on voluntary counseling and testing centers (VCTCs), clinics at FBOs, and the development of, and training in the use of, the HRIMS (Human Resources Information Management System). These clinical and non-clinical activities have both direct and indirect impacts on the wide spectrum of HIV prevention and care, in such areas as availability and adherence to early diagnosis, appropriate antiretroviral treatment (ART), prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT), and linkages of diagnosis and treatment of HIV and TB, etc. Now past mid-term and approaching the expected end of project in September 2013, and in the context of extraordinary success of the overall Namibian HIV Program, it is the opinion of the assessment team that the IntraHealth project has been a major success in meeting its objectives, though not without attendant current and future problems described in the evaluation.","Evaluated project title: Namibia HIV prevention, care and support ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health technical assistance bridge (GH tech bridge)",Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-C-12-00004,,6/1/2012 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Health facilities ~|~_©_~|~ Health care planning ~|~_©_~|~ Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) for HIV/AIDS,Namibia,674-A-00-09-00003-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT792.pdf,531 KB,"011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

The first task is to analyze the costs and benefits of how MEASURE DHS operates within this complex and changing environment with an emphasis on contractors success in delivering two aspects of their operation: (a) responding to the varied needs of key stakeholders, and (b) providing technical assistance (TA) in survey content, design, and implementation. The evaluation team identified needs within the manageable interests of the project and TA approaches that might increase contractors TA performance (including those that may not be part of the current project approach). The second evaluation task is to assess the feasibility and appropriateness of the capacity building goals laid out in the MEASURE DHS contract in light of the increased complexities of survey work and global demand for high quality and timely information by examining stakeholder (particularly host country stakeholder) needs and advising on approaches that might increase contractor capacity building performance.

PD-ACT-744,"Pakistans large and rapidly growing population challenges the country's ability to provide essential services, economic opportunities, and a good quality of life for its citizens. Furthermore, high total fertility rates put children and women at greater risk for higher mortality and poor overall health. Most non-first births in Pakistan fall into the high-risk category, and infant and maternal mortality rates remain high. Evidence shows that longer intervals between births can reduce the incidence of both neonatal and maternal mortality. Pakistan instituted a comprehensive and detailed family planning program in the mid-1960s to address the impact of poor birth spacing and high fertility and has continued to explore different approaches to expand family planning services, improve quality, and reach underserved areas. Family planning services were delivered primarily through the separate Population and Welfare Ministry and not connected to the Ministry of Health services.",'Contracted Under No. GS-23F-8012H and Order No. AID-391-M-11-00001' ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Family advancement for life and health (FALAH) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Independent monitoring and evaluation contract (IMEC),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-391-M-11-00001,,3/1/2012 0:00,,Family health care ~|~_©_~|~ Population growth ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Health service utilization ~|~_©_~|~ Quality of life ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Fertility ~|~_©_~|~ Women ~|~_©_~|~ Maternal mortality ~|~_©_~|~ Child mortality ~|~_©_~|~ Health risk,Pakistan,391-A-00-07-01092-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT744.pdf,2316 KB,"003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

The evaluation was conducted in AprilMay 2012. The $12 million award applies from May 2009September 2013, and the evaluation covered the project period from June 2009December 2011.MH is being implemented in 21 districts in three low-performing divisions of Bangladesh (Chittagong, Barisal, and Sylhet) and is addressing two important areas in family planning and maternal health that have not received adequate attention and have not shown significant results in the recent past: 1) the need for family planning through the expansion of access, quality, and use of long-acting and permanent methods of contraception (LA/PM) and 2) selective maternal health services to prevent postpartum hemorrhage (PPH), including active management of the third stage of labor (AMTSL) and the community-based provision of misoprostol. The key purposes of this performance evaluation were to: 1) review, analyze, and evaluate the effectiveness of the MH project in achieving program objectives to date; 2) identify major constraints in achieving expected project results; and 3) provide specific recommendations and lessons learned on strategies and approaches the program should pursue over the last two years of implementation and in future program planning.

PD-ACT-666,"The purpose of this mid-term evaluation of Economic Growth Project Task Order 5 (PCE TO5) is to assess progress to date and identify areas for improvement and actions that will facilitate attainment of project objectives.&nbsp; The purpose of PCE TO5 is to increase food security and reduce poverty through a set of interrelated activities, and thus contribute to the overarching goal of Feed the Future strategy (FTF): (1) to sustainably reduce poverty and hunger; (2) to improve equitable growth in the agricultural sector; and (3) to improve nutritional status of the Senegalese people.&nbsp; Specifically, the project is the key instrument for achieving two (out of four) first level objectives of the USAID/Senegal Feed the Future strategy: inclusive agricultural sector growth, and increased trade.&nbsp; The evaluation focused exclusively on the four areas of the project aligned with USAID/Senegal's Feed the Future strategy: (1) increased agricultural productivity and market linkages; (2) enhanced policy environment; (3) increased post-harvest and access to finance; and (4) Increased institutional capacity and human resources.&nbsp; As a result of the evaluation, conducted March 15-April 2012 in Senegal, the evaluators found that overall PCE TO5 (or simply PCE) has made good progress in its three years (April 2009-March 2012) of implementation toward its objectives and done so despite a significant budget cut that impacted its FY 2011 activities going forward.&nbsp; However, the achievements have at times proven uneven across components over these three years of implementation in large part due to the cuts and other difficulties.&nbsp; The evaluators have also included in the report several emendations for each FTF component as well as for cross-cutting areas.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","Submitted to: USAID/Senegal ~|~_©_~|~ ""Contract No.: AID-AEG-I-OO-04-00010, task order No. 38"" ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order title: Economic growth project task order 5 (PCE TO5) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Support for accelerated growth and increased competitiveness (SAGIC) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Rural and agricultural incomes with a sustainable environment plus (RAISE plus) ~|~_©_~|~ French ed.: PD-ACU-124",Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-685-TO-12-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ AEG-I-00-04-00010-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-AEG-I-00-04-00010,,7/1/2012 0:00,,Economic growth ~|~_©_~|~ Value chains ~|~_©_~|~ Market structure ~|~_©_~|~ Finance ~|~_©_~|~ Integrated rural development ~|~_©_~|~ Economic infrastructure ~|~_©_~|~ Industrial capacity ~|~_©_~|~ Human capacity development,Senegal,685-I-05-06-00005-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 685-I-00-06-00005-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-685-I-05-06-00005 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-685-I-00-06-00005,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT666.pdf,1100 KB,"007239 - Weidemann Associates, Inc.",,013469 - USAID.

PD-ACT-652,"ESI was specifically concerned with information systems that measure and inform the United States Government (USG) PEPFAR program in South Africa, and the South African Government (SAG) HIV and AIDS program activities. The ESI Project (and thus this evaluation) focused on two distinct areas: 1) refinements to the web-based information system for program reporting and performance monitoring; 2) building the capacity of PEPFAR and SAG implementing partners to collect, report, and use high-quality data and strategic information for purposes of program management at the implementation level.The Project was designed to put in place a technical assistance organization/contractor with the technical scope and capacity to refine the information systems structure to improve its user interaction, and analytical functionality and tools; to serve as the information systems administrator and technical support office for users; and to simultaneously build the awareness, motivation and capacity PEPFAR and SAG managers to place high value on data quality and use of data/information for performance management purposes.This evaluation was both summative and formative in nature. It covered the period from inception of ESI in 2008, through March 2012, and considered key areas of ESI Project performance including: the appropriateness of the Projects development hypothesis; the adequacy of the Projects management; and the Projects performance including key achievements and gaps.

PD-ACT-620,"<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Market-based Partnerships for Health (MBPH) was a $13.5 million USAID/India funded project implemented by Abt Associates between October 1, 2008 and May 11, 2012. MBPH aimed to improve the environment for commercial sector engagement in USAID/India&rsquo;s key priority health areas by forging partnerships between the private and public sectors. MBPH fostered market-based partnerships in: (1) reproductive health, maternal health, and child health, including promotion of good hygiene, such as hand washing; (2) safe water; (3) prevention of indoor air pollution (IAP); and (4) the control of tuberculosis. MBPH, which was operational in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Karnataka, had two primary objectives: (1) build on, implement, institutionalize, and scale-up MBPH models; and (2) explore new commercial-sector opportunities to accelerate public health improvements, especially in base-of-pyramid (BoP) and rural population groups, improving access, demand, and service delivery through health and non-health partners. The program aimed to create and nurture MBPH models that can be brought to scale by commercial partners, government programs, and/or civil society groups. The program also sought to institutionalize local capacity to broker market-based partnerships for health in the future by supporting the establishment of a Center of Excellence. The final evaluation had three purposes: (1) review and analyze the overall program strategies and technical approaches adopted; (2) review and assess the effectiveness of the processes adopted for MBPH innovations, including planning, monitoring, finance, and technical support; and (3) provide recommendations on future directions, especially introducing new and/or continuing approaches for innovations with the private sector. The evaluators found that MBPH project successfully designed, implemented, and evaluated a wide range of private partnerships and initiatives that addressed a number of critical public health issues. In less than four years, and with a modest budget, MPBH made significant progress, building upon previous partnership models and exploring new opportunities to engage commercial private sector partners to test approaches ultimately designed to improve health outcomes for BoP families. The key MBPH achievements are: (1) developed eight partnership models; (2) demonstrated some success in execution, cost sharing, and commitment of partners to scale-up (or at least have scale-up potential) in each model; (3) introduced nine health companies to profitable BoP markets; and (4) leveraged over six million dollars from partners.

USAID Ethiopia developed the scope of the work (SOW), provided input to the assessment methodology and the assessment instruments, and participated in the site visits. The purpose of this capacity-building assessment is three fold: Assess the appropriateness of the various capacity-building tools and approaches used by the partners; Identify the effectiveness of local capacity-building interventions; Identify potential future directions for capacity-building interventions. The assessment examined the progress being made to sustain three integrated and reinforcing components of capacity-building: individual/workforce development: institutional strengthening and system development; and resource use/management and external organizational environment.",Project title: Global health technical assistance (GH tech),Special Evaluation,Documents,GHS-I-00-05-00005-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GHS-I-00-05-00005,,11/1/2011 0:00,,Organizational capacity ~|~_©_~|~ Implementation ~|~_©_~|~ Local capacity building ~|~_©_~|~ HIV/AIDS,Ethiopia,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU381.pdf,1064 KB,"011976 - QED Group, LLC",,"011222 - USAID.

PD-ACT-577,"Balochistan is the least developed province of Pakistan. Besides a higher incidence of poverty than other provinces, Balochistan also exhibits a higher level of gender disparity due to lack of education and conservative social norms. According to the Labor Force Survey 2010-11, Balochistan's female labor force participation was at six percent. This is much lower than the national average of 15 percent or that of Punjab at 20 percent. Most women lack mobility and are largely homebound. Even women who are involved in agricultural activities serve as unpaid family workers and their ownership of important assets or land appears to be extremely limited. While homebound, the women of Balochistan inherit a rich tradition of embroidery.

PD-ACT-240,"This report on the Ambassador's Small Grants Program (ASGP) to Support Gender Equality in Afghanistan evaluates the effectiveness and design of ASGP's support for women-focused civil society organizations (CSOs). An evaluation team examined whether and how ASGP provided opportunities for gender equality and empowerment, and if it reduced gender-related constraints through USAID-funded activities. The team found that ASGP's goal of improving the status and quality of life of Afghan women by strengthening the capacity of women-focused CSOs was only partially met. Larger and more well-established organizations were better able to take advantage of this assistance, and therefore they and their beneficiaries benefitted more t from ASGP grants. Short-term awards impeded progress towards the sustainability of the organizations and the award's ability to improve the grantee CSOs' sustainability. Capacity-building implemented by consultants rather than using a participatory model created dependency rather than empowerment. Recommendations include: (1) use a small grants program model; (2) integrate gender equality into analyses and decision-making; (3) increase award and program duration; (4) begin future activities with a needs assessment; (5) emphasize transparency and accountability; support Afghan's women's movement and local NGOs; (6) link USAID programs and grantees, beneficiaries, and other USAID program partners to local government institutions; and (7) develop an internal process that would ensure collaboration among programs with similar goals and objectives, but avoid duplication.

It totaled $12,273,815 in USAID funding, with $7,528,815 for NDI programs and $4,745,000 for IRI programs. The program focused primarily on supporting the development of political parties in Serbia. The overall goal of the program was to support USAID/Serbia's Strategic Objective 3: Risk of Political Instability Reduced through support of key democratic structures and processes. Based on the findings of this evaluation, this goal should be considered successfully achieved. Pro-democratic forces prevailed in every election during the time period of this program, especially in the election of 2008, which brought to power a party coalition that has maintained a stable government since that time.",Task order no.

PD-ACT-374,"The Citizen Advocacy Partnership Program II (CAPP II) implemented by the Centres for Civil Initiatives (CCI) has resulted in a number of clear impacts on the policy reform process in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BIH) in the area of government accountability. At the same time, the impacts are somewhat diffused in a manner that still does not add up to larger reform progress in any of the specific component areas within government accountability.

PD-ACT-381,"Balochistan is the least developed province of Pakistan, with levels of human development that are much below Pakistan's, greater gender disparities, higher poverty, greater food insecurity, and poor infrastructure. Government allocations for development are small in relation to the size of the province and the spread of the population, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) have a limited presence. Small farmers and the poor are unorganized, which, together with scattered settlements and low population density, makes service delivery much more costly than in other provinces. The poor have meager access to services. The operating environment for development projects has been especially testing in recent years in the presence of an insurgency and frequent targeted killings and kidnappings. Implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations (UN), the United States Assistance to Balochistan Border Areas (US ABBA) project is working in five districts of Balochistan, namely, Killa Saifullah, Loralai, Mastung, Quetta, and Zhob. The project has been active in the first three of these districts since 2005, and in the other two since 2009. US ABBA aims to mobilize small farmers, promote agricultural development, and address rural poverty. The project portfolio spans social and human capital formation, community infrastructure development, the demonstration and diffusion of agricultural technology, and linkages between producers and markets.

The LOKAL program was a four-year project funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) designed to improve local governance and support the decentralization process in Haiti by strengthening the capacity and transparency of local governments and improving their ability to provide goods and services to their communities. Designed as an element of USAID/Haitis 20052010 strategy under the Governing More Effectively and Democratically Strategic Objective, the LOKAL program had four main components: (1) completing and implementing a legal framework for decentralization; (2) building local capacity; (3) managing a small grants program; and (4) managing information and disseminating lessons learned. Field operations began in December 2007 through a task order under the Decentralization and Democratic Local Governance Indefinite Quantity Contract (IQC) mechanism. A separate six-month extension contract was awarded June 30, 2011, extending the period of performance to December 31, 2011.

It then suggests the adjustments that that should be made to maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of the project as it works to draw from experience gained, primarily in the Western Region, to detail a model for a nested governance system that addresses the priority issues for both coastal and fisheries governance in Ghana. This summary draws upon a self-assessment of the project prepared at the close of Year 1 (included in the Our Coast Our Future document), and self-assessments conducted with the projects international and Ghanaian partners in March and July of 2011. The central objective of the ICFG Initiative is to assemble the pre-conditions for a formally constituted and decentralized coastal and fisheries governance program for Ghanas Western Region that can serve as a model for the nation. As an expression of the ecosystem approach, these preconditions include: Clearly defined goals that resonate with stakeholders; Constituencies that support such goals and a plan of action to achieve them; Governmental commitment expressed as a mandate, the necessary authorities and the resources to successfully implement the program; and, The institutional capacity to sustain the initiative on into the future.","""Integrated Coastal and Fisheries Governance Initiative for the Western Region, Ghana""",Special Evaluation,Documents,641-A-00-09-00036-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-641-A-00-09-00036,,9/1/2011 0:00,,Coastal fisheries ~|~_©_~|~ Fishery management ~|~_©_~|~ Fishery development ~|~_©_~|~ Business growth ~|~_©_~|~ Governance,Ghana,641-A-00-09-00036-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-641-A-00-09-00036,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT294.pdf,912 KB,007437 - University of Rhode Island.

PD-ACT-242,"USAID Liberia initiated the Land Rights and Community Forestry Program (LRCFP) in December of 2007 to advance the policy and practice of land and forest management in Liberia. The program was designed to improve the legal and policy environment for community forest management, build the capacity of the national forest service and communities to develop and sustain community forestry programs and generate environmentallysustainable and equitable economic benefits for rural residents. At the national level, LRCFP supported the passage of the Community Rights Law and associated regulations, and built the capacity of the Forestry Development Authority (FDA). At the local level, the program facilitated the creation of five community forests and introduced improved livelihood practices in Nimba and Sinoe Counties. Work of the primary contractor for LRCFP concluded on October 28, 2011.The purpose of this evaluation is to assess the implementation and impact of LRCFP, identify strategies taken to adapt to evolving challenges and opportunities, and determine and report on the implications for further investment in Liberia and for USAID more broadly. A team of five specialists in agriculture, forestry, biodiversity and land tenure reviewed the available documentation and spent two weeks in Liberia engaging with national and community participants in the program. Although intense rains and time constraints limited access to community participants, the team nevertheless interviewed over 30 community representatives and 50 people total.

PD-ACS-486,"This report evaluates the performance of the Support for Trade Acceleration Projects (USAID/STAR I and STAR II) that were conducted under contract to Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) in Vietnam between 2001 and 2010 and ventures a look forward, partially based on the scope of work for the follow-up to STAR II, known as STAR+. The confluence of a unique set of circumstances created the initial demand for STAR in 2001 and gave it the impetus to propel it forward. The Government of Vietnam (GVN) adopted a new economic growth strategy in the 1990s to transition to a market-based economy and open the economy to international trade. The GVN used a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) with the United States and accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) as instruments to accelerate the transition process. The GVN requested technical assistance to facilitate revision of its commercial laws, legal procedures, transparency and appeals processes to meet BTA and WTO requirements. The GVN established an effective command structure to coordinate and direct technical assistance, backed by GVN senior political authority. USAID management granted broad operational flexibility to the technical assistance providers. USAID/Vietnams STAR Project Performance: Notwithstanding STARs enormous advantage in providing assistance to a host country government that placed high priority on legal and procedural reforms, STAR effectively delivered a large volume and variety of technical assistance typically using the same tools employed by other USAID technical assistance projects (e.g. technical experts, workshops, study tours, discussions and seminars with clients), but with greater impact. The STAR programs accomplished their objective to help the GVN satisfy BTA and WTO accession requirements.",Evaluated project title: Support for trade acceleration I (STAR I) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Support for trade acceleration II (STAR II) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Business growth initiative (BGI),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,EEM-C-00-06-00022-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-EEM-C-00-06-00022,,5/1/2011 0:00,,Trade promotion ~|~_©_~|~ International trade ~|~_©_~|~ Economic growth ~|~_©_~|~ Strategic planning ~|~_©_~|~ Market development ~|~_©_~|~ Economies in transition ~|~_©_~|~ Commercial law ~|~_©_~|~ Transparency ~|~_©_~|~ Business support services,Vietnam,GEG-I-05-04-00001-00 ~|~_©_~|~ GEG-I-00-04-00001-00 ~|~_©_~|~ PCE-I-833-98-00017-00 ~|~_©_~|~ PCE-I-00-98-00017-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GEG-I-05-04-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GEG-I-00-04-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-PCE-I-00-98-00017,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACS486.pdf,619 KB,"007239 - Weidemann Associates, Inc.",,"011274 - USAID.

PD-ACS-522,"In August-September 2011, Social Impact, Inc. (SI) with sub-contractor Management Systems International (MSI), carried out an evaluation of the major components of the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Prevention Program (GEP) for the clean energy and environment office (CLEEO) of USAID/India. The largest component of this long-running (April 1995-September 2011) program in India focused on reducing CO2 emissions from coal-fired thermal power plants. This GEP component was implemented in close partnership with the countrys biggest power producer, NTPC Ltd. Most elements of the program were implemented by the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) and the United States Department of Energy (DOE) through a Participating Agency Service Agreement (PASA). USAID contributed a total of $39.2 million to support GEP activities, of which $5.2 million was used for direct contracting by USAID with Louis Berger International, and $2 million for other, smaller contracts.The original objective of GEP was to reduce the volume of emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) per energy unit generated in the coal-based power sector, while increasing energy productivity and encouraging biomass fuel use in selected utilities and sugar industries. The initial phase of GEP (1995-2000) was composed of two components, Efficient Coal Conversion (ECC) and Alternative Bagasse Cogeneration (ABC), aimed respectively at increasing awareness, available information, and practical examples of the applicability of the state-of-the-art pollution prevention, efficient coal conversion and combustion for power generation, and industrial co-generation technologies in sugar mills. In 1999, new activities under the Climate Change Supplement (CCS) were added to the agreement with the government of India. The PASA was modified in 2003 to include several new areas (distributed generation, alternative transportation, hydrogen economy, and regulatory assistance).",Evaluation services indefinite quantity contract ~|~_©_~|~ Restricted ed.: PD-ACS-521,Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-386-TO-10-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00019 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00019-00,,9/1/2011 0:00,,Clean energy ~|~_©_~|~ Pollution control ~|~_©_~|~ Greenhouse gas emissions ~|~_©_~|~ Energy planning,India,386-P-00-00-00067-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-386-P-00-00-00067,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACS522.pdf,525 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,"008557 - USAID.

PD-ACS-539,"In January-February 2011, USAID/Cambodia commissioned a mid-term evaluation of its health program that spans the period from fiscal year 2009 to 2013. The Program is comprised of an inter-related set of activities implemented by four USAID partners, Reproductive Health Association of Cambodia (RHAC), Reproductive and Child Health Alliance (RACHA), University Research Co. (URC) and Population Services International (PSI). The scope of the evaluation included the following areas: maternal, newborn and child health, family planning and reproductive health, water and sanitation, nutrition, infectious diseases (tuberculosis, avian influenza, H1N1); health systems strengthening, private sector health services and products, behavior change communication, and community mobilization. The review focused on the progress and issues across the program areas rather than on a detailed performance assessment of each USAID partner. The evaluation team interviewed a set of stakeholders at the national and sub-national levels, visited six of the ten provinces to view the work of the program at the provincial, district, facility and community levels, and reviewed an extensive set of documents, program performance data and national data sets.Substantial progress is evident toward establishing reliable health services, especially at the Health Center (HC) and community levels. HCs are better staffed, equipped and supplied, many with 24-hour service. There are a substantially increased number of deliveries happening in facilities, with a higher proportional rise in USAID-targeted provinces than elsewhere. Although there remains a considerable unmet need for emergency obstetric care, a 47% increase in Cesarean sections for obstetrical complications at hospitals in the USAID targeted provinces between 2007 and 2010 indicates progress. Health Equity Funds have visibly increased access to life-saving services for the poor.","Evaluation of programs implemented 2008-2013 by: Population Services International (PSI) (442-A-00-08-00001-00) -- Reproductive and Child Health Alliance (RACHA) (442-A-00-08-00008-00) -- Reproductive Association of Cambodia (RHAC) (442-A-00-08-00007-00) -- University Research Co., LLC (URC) (442-A-00-09-00007-00)",Special Evaluation,Documents,442-A-00-08-00007-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 442-A-00-08-00008-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 442-A-00-09-00007-00,,3/1/2011 0:00,,Maternal child health care ~|~_©_~|~ Care of the newborn ~|~_©_~|~ Reproductive health ~|~_©_~|~ Water sanitation ~|~_©_~|~ Infectious diseases ~|~_©_~|~ Behavior change ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Community behavior ~|~_©_~|~ Community mobilization ~|~_©_~|~ Obstetrics,Cambodia,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACS539.pdf,783 KB,008523 - USAID.

PD-ACR-999,"The purpose of this evaluation of USAID/Cambodias HIV/AIDS portfolio was to assess the performance of the current program and make recommendations to guide USAID investments in HIV/AIDS for the next five years. The scope of work specified two overarching questions: 1)How well have past Mission investments in HIV/AIDS performed? and 2)How should the Mission invest resources in HIV/AIDS during the next five years? USAID technical assistance in Cambodia has a long track record of testing potential innovations and model development, piloting and adaptation. There are numerous examples of replication and scale up of USAID-developed models. These include replication of prevention program models developed by USAID, using Global Fund monies, and the national roll-out of a continuum of care (CoC) model, based on a USAID pilot. Nonetheless, Global Fund grants have had an insufficient emphasis on technical oversight and quality assurance. USAID continues to add value beyond its own programming in these areas. USAID/Cambodia has successfully developed the technical and organizational capacity of national and community level NGOs to be major contributors to prevention and care and treatment programming. This has been critical to program success.",,Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-442-O-00-00008,,7/1/2011 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Disease treatment ~|~_©_~|~ Health care administration ~|~_©_~|~ Monitoring,Cambodia,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACR999.pdf,1453 KB,,,013626 - U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) ~|~_©_~|~ 008523 - USAID.

PD-ACS-202,"The purpose of this report is to provide an independent and objective assessment of the developmental impact of the 27-year United States Telecommunications Training Institutes (USTTI) ICT training program. Established in 1982 as a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation, USTTI is a public-private partnership (PPP) between the United States Government (USG) and US-based telecommunications/ICT companies. It provides a wide range of specialized, tuition-free training to policy-makers, regulators and public- and private-sector executives and professionals from the developing world. The program has offered 1,600 individual training courses at a variety of locations in the US and graduated over 8,000 women and men representing 168 countries worldwide. From the outset, USTTI has received financial and technical support from a variety of corporate, academic and USG sources. Since 2005, USTTI has received $1 million annually from USAID, while the cumulative total from USAID since 1985 under a succession of grant agreements has amounted to $15,942,785. The Impact Assessments findings and conclusions are based on: (1) a review of pertinent documentation; (2) interviews with USAID personnel, USTTI board members and staff, representatives of USG institutions and private corporations involved in the USTTI program, and instructors/presenters; (3) an electronic survey of training participants; (4) telephone follow-up interviews with a sample of respondents to the electronic survey; and (5) visits to 11 countries to interview USTTI participants and their supervisors and colleagues. It should be noted that, due to lack of information, it was not possible to contact USTTI participants who were trained prior to 1996. Of the training recipients since 1996, 37% responded to the electronic survey. An important purpose of the telephone and site visit data collection was to explore the extent of, and potentially correct for, any positive bias in the survey response.",Cover title: United States Telecommunications Training Institute impact assessment : final evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Footer title: USTTI impact assessment ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global broadband and innovations (GBi) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title also known as: Project title: GBI broadband and innovations,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,RAN-I-00-09-00015-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00015 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-CIO-TO-10-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-CIO-I-10-00001,,7/1/2011 0:00,,Information systems ~|~_©_~|~ Technical training ~|~_©_~|~ Impact assessment ~|~_©_~|~ Public private partnerships ~|~_©_~|~ Telecommunications technology ~|~_©_~|~ Mass media,Latin America ~|~_©_~|~ Central and Eastern Europe ~|~_©_~|~ East Africa,AID-CIO-TO-10-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-CIO-I-10-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACS202.pdf,27206 KB,"011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

PD-ACR-860,"The Transparency and Accountability Grants (TAG) program was implemented at a time when the Government of Lebanon (GOL) was struggling to combat corruption. TAG was implemented as one of the activities supporting USAIDs program strategy designed to promote and foster transparency, accountability and good governance in civil society as well as in central and local governments. TAG was conceived in 1999 and implemented in 2001 under a Cooperative Agreement (CA) between AMIDEAST and USAID/Lebanon. Although TAG was implemented as a one-year program it was extended to 10 years, until February 2011, through a series of consecutive CA modifications. Over the years the cumulative value of TAG grew from $655,000 in 20012 to $9,350,900 by February 2011. The program went through 20 CA modifications and amendments. TAG provided small grants (less than USD $50,000) to a wide range of civil society organizations and individuals that worked to promote and foster transparency, accountability and good governance. Eight organizations, however, were provided grants between $50,000 and $100,000.",Task order no. 07 ~|~_©_~|~ Contract no. listed on document as: RAN-I-00-09-00019 ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Transparency and accountability grant (TAG) ~|~_©_~|~ 'This publication .... was prepared by the staff of Performance Management Plan for Lebanon (PMPL) project ....',Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-RAN-I-07-09-00019 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00019 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-07-09-00019-00 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00019-00,,5/1/2011 0:00,,Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Political corruption ~|~_©_~|~ Accountability,Lebanon,268-A-00-01-00204-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-268-A-00-01-00204,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACR860.pdf,874 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID),English,application/pdf,Performance evaluation (2011 definition),,,Civil society,May-11,,,,Transparency & accountability grant project : summative evaluation final,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTU4MDk5,Lebanon,,,2011-05-01,2011,LBN,LBN_2011,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PD-ACR-850,"Through the analysis and elaboration of 4 case studies, the external, mid-term review of the USAID/Peru Pro Decentralization Project (2008-2012) provides insight into the project's progress in contributing to the definition of national decentralization policy, and translating that policy into sub-national practice.  The review offers credible analysis on the relevance, effectiveness and impacts of the program to date and offers recommendations to inform future programming decisions and improve project performance and accountability.  The four case studies analyze Pro Decentralization's policy and institutional strengthening work in: (1) budgeting for results; (2) the National Public Investment System (SNIP); (3) modernization of state governments; and (4) the extent to which the Pro Decentralization Program complements the work of USAID's strategic projects and partners in Peru.

PD-ACR-570,"CORE seeks to address the disparity in economic development between the conflict-affected Eastern Province and the bordering provinces of North Central and Uva, on the one hand, and the rest of Sri Lanka, on the other hand. This is accomplished through an integrated approach: (1) that extends value chains broadly and deeply into the grassroots level; (2) that gives individuals the skills and knowledge they need to participate as entrepreneurs and workers in value chains; and (3) that improves the business environment to enable value chains to achieve greater competitiveness. The reviewers believe that the CORE project is on the right track and has made considerable progress over the past year and a half. It is ready to enter a ""take-off"" stage where many of its activities should begin to succeed and achieve the results intended. They also believe that the results in the next year and a half should demonstrate that the project should be extended for the option years, but that decision should be made no later than the middle of year three. This would ensure continuity of the activities and productive relationships with the private sector if the project shows further evidence that positive results are being achieved.

PD-ACR-583,"Based on a review of quantitative and qualitative information and data from the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership (TSCTP), it can be concluded that USAID's Niger, Chad and Mali programs have had some positive impact -- most strikingly on lower-level programmatic goals such as civic engagement and listenership for USAID-sponsored radio. Results on higher-level goals, measured through surveys on attitudes towards extremism, were also positive in the aggregate but less dramatic. Despite this empirical evidence of program impact, implementation of the TSTCP has coincided with a worsening of the terrorist threat in parts of the Sahel, indicating a continued need for counter-extremism programming.

PD-ACR-618,"Building on the success of the Early Grade Reading Assessment (EGRA) as a measurement tool, many countries have begun to show interest in moving away from assessments alone and toward interventions focused on changing teacher pedagogy, and as a result, increasing student reading achievement. Liberia, for example, began an EGRA-based intervention, called EGRA Plus: Liberia, in 2008. The results from the EGRA Plus midterm evaluation showed very promising results on a variety of learning outcomes. This report is an impact evaluation of the EGRA Plus program at project completion, and it presents compelling evidence that a targeted reading intervention focused on improving the quality of reading instruction in primary schools can have a remarkably large impact on student achievement in a relatively limited amount of time.

The review offers credible analysis on the relevance, effectiveness and impacts of the program to date and offers recommendations to inform future programming decisions and improve project performance and accountability.  The four case studies analyze Pro Decentralization's policy and institutional strengthening work in: (1) budgeting for Results; (2) the National Public Investment System (SNIP); (3) modernization of State Governments; and (4) the extent to which the Pro Decentralization Program complements the work of USAID's strategic projects and partners in Peru.

In general it has been a positive force in technically equipping regional and sub-regional health organizations.  Moreover, its assistance has been well-received by African counterparts and their institutions. However Africa 2010's mandate is so broad -- provide technical support to AFR/SD and multiple African sub-regional institutions covering virtually all the public health areas that USAID covers -- that its input into any particular activity or institution can often be limited.

PD-ACR-168,"This evaluation is of the Trade and Investment Reform Support Program in Azerbaijan (TIRSP), a USAID-sponsored initiative managed by contractor Chemonics, Inc. The Evaluation Team commends all three components of the TIRSP initiative. Component One revived Azerbaijan's path to accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO). Component Two responded to the Azerbaijani business community, advising on the many areas of trade and investment policy and law. Component Three educated Azerbaijanis in and outside public service with timely advice on cost-benefit analysis and macroeconomic modeling. The quality of the work reviewed by the Evaluation Team ranged from solid and competent to superb. Local counterparts largely agree. Yet TIRSP as a whole is somehow less than the sum of its parts. The issue is one of design and implementation: TIRSP was greatly, if not nearly entirely, task oriented, both in design and implementation: As designed, TIRSP conceived WTO accession and trade and investment as separate, yet related, endeavors. As implemented, Component One featured many initiatives aimed at conformity to WTO guidelines. This task orientation was transferred to Component Two and was further perpetuated by the many areas covered by the theme of trade and investment. The Evaluation Team finds that this task orientation came at the cost of policy. To be clear, ""policy"" is defined as an idea or related aids formulated by government to advance a public purpose -- in this case, trade and investment reform moving to market liberalization. Laws, regulations, and statements of government intention may all reflect policy. Policies should also come with a ""policy narrative,"" a broad-based message expressed in ordinary language and directed at the public and across government offices, in order to explain why a given policy is relevant and beneficial to the public. ""Policy objectives"" are specific anticipated goals or achievements resulting from the execution of a policy. In the case of TIRSP, the Evaluation Team finds that task-orientation created the following deficiencies: (1) absence of a clear policy narrative as to why various tasks undertaken through TIRSP would benefit the Azerbaijani economy; and (2) thus inadequate explanation of the importance of tasks, leading to a number of initiatives on law, regulation and policy that could not be completed successfully. The nature of the problem lies in project design and project implementation, both executed by TIRSP executives and USAID personnel at strategic and operational levels.

PD-ACR-169,"The Private Sector Competitiveness Enhancement Project (PSCEP) is a $6,588,557, three year project of USAID/Azerbaijan's Economic Growth office and implemented by Chemonics International.  The project began in September 2008, and will end in December 2010, ten months earlier than originally anticipated.  USAID/Azerbaijan has commissioned this assessment both as way of judging the effectiveness and impacts of the project, and also to provide guidance to USAID's successor project (Azerbaijan Competitiveness and Trade (ACT) project) which is starting in late 2010. Although there were some design and implementation problems that will be described below, and a difficult business environment overall, PSCEP did achieve at least two major successes: improvements in the dairy sector that have brought about substantial income gains for thousands of farmers, and re-establishment of the aquaculture industry in Azerbaijan after it had declined by 90% over the past twenty years. In most respects, PSCEP follows a fairly conventional competitiveness/value chain methodology.  However, three aspects of the design and/or implementation stand out as being different from similar projects in other countries, and it does appear that these differences have contributed to short-falls in overall project effectiveness: (1) an unnecessarily complex analytical process used in sector selection; (2) too much emphasis on investment as a primary project objective; and (3) an unrealistic timeline for achieving indicators, As a result, after fifteen months of the three-year project, 62% of the budget had been consumed.  Once the sector-specific technical assistance began, it does appear that much of it was effective.  There were particularly beneficial results in the dairy sector, and aquaculture.  Other firm-specific successes were noted with green-house farming and high-value agriculture (strawberries), but because often a small number of individuals benefitted, the cost-benefit of this assistance is questionable. It should be noted that private sector economic growth is difficult in Azerbaijan, mainly because of monopolization of key sectors in the economy and a general lack of transparency.  Even a well-designed and well-run project will have difficulty achieving significant results in Azerbaijan.  In addition, the project design contained certain mandated activities and targets that affected the implementation in negative ways.  That said, it is also clear that the project fell short of achieving some of its benchmarks and targets and that the work of the implementer was not always cost-effective. Among the key lessons that can be taken from this project are: (1) the necessity of having targets and benchmarks that are appropriate for the project goals and design; (2) to realize that proper timing and sequencing of actions is essential to sound project management; and (3) to manage the use of project resources so that they are applied in the most cost-effective manner relative to project goals.

PD-ACR-202,"This evaluation concludes that USAID and U.S. government programs have contributed substantively toward the goal to expand the number of people that benefit from global trade through trade capacity building (TCB). Project documents detail a range of successful USAID strategies that help firms and governments meet the demands of the international marketplace, improve the policy environment for trade, and enable countries' trade and logistics systems to function more efficiently. The evaluation found U.S. assistance to be significantly associated with increases in the value of recipient countries' exports, after controlling for a wide range of factors that have influenced international trade flows over the last decade. Other investigative techniques revealed assistance synergies that can improve the results of TCB assistance. Important among these strategies is working toward more competitive public and private sector practices simultaneously. Synergies are also found in combining training, analysis, technical advice, and equipment to deliver an integrated assistance package. Further analysis revealed the critical importance of strong relations with counterparts and the coordination of assistance with counterparts' own reform processes. In short, this evaluation found that U.S. TCB assistance since the launch of WTO negotiations in 2001 has had a positive impact in developing countries.

PD-ACQ-711,"The USAID-funded Decentralized Basic Education (DBE) Project aims to improve basic education delivery in Indonesia. The DBE1component aims specifically to improve the management and governance of basic education at the level of districts as well as schools and Islamic madrasah. The purpose of this study is to describe the impact of DBE1 on schools and madrasah, as assessed in a number of studies. Throughout this report, the term 'school' is taken to include madrasah and regular schools, both public and private. Project activity commenced early 2006 in the first cohort of elementary schools; some 526 schools in 25 districts spread over eight provinces. In early 2009, after three years of project implementation, DBE1 began to conduct a comprehensive study to assess the impact of DBE1 programs to support school-based management in these schools, as reported in Chapter Two. While routine monitoring, which is reported in Chapter Three, provides evidence that suggests project outputs are having an impact in improving management and governance in schools, its main purpose is to measure project implementation performance. This present impact study, using both qualitative and quantitative approaches, is needed to better measure impact of DBE1 interventions as well as the nature of that impact and factors associated with success and failure. While DBE1 works intensively at both district and school levels and has pioneered important approaches to improving the management and governance of basic education at both, the scope of this study is confined to the level of school and community. The study is also confined for the most part to the first cohort of 526 target schools, where the program has been running for at least three years with direct support from DBE1.

PD-ACN-883,"To address some of the challenges created by lack of access to safe water, in 2004, the United States Agency for International Development's (USAID) Global Development Alliance (GDA) brought together Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs (CCP), Population Services International (PSI), CARE USA, and Procter &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) to create the Safe Drinking Water Alliance (SDWA).  The general goal of the Alliance was to test three marketing models to increase demand for water treatment and to identify the potential of P&amp;G's PUR in each model as an alternative POU technology.  PUR is a household-based water treatment product that combines disinfection with removal of dirt and other pollutants and transforms turbid contaminated water into clear, potable water.  The three models tested by the SWDA included: (1) a commercial marketing model with full cost recovery in Pakistan; (2) a social marketing model where some promotional costs were subsidized in Haiti; and (3) an emergency relief model in Ethiopia. In Pakistan and Haiti a combination of behavior change communication activities and PUR-branded messages and materials were disseminated to increase the demand for water treatment and to introduce PUR.  In both countries, CCP led the behavior change campaigns, while in Haiti PSI handled the specific promotion and distribution of PUR.  In Pakistan, P&amp;G focused on creating demand for PUR.  In Ethiopia, CARE staff working in the Community-Based Therapeutic program were fully in charge of introducing PUR and providing the motivation and information for its use. In all three contexts SDWA partners also studied barriers and facilitators to sustained water treatment behaviors, as well as reactions to and use of PUR specifically.  Findings have clear programmatic relevance, and add to the emerging literature on water treatment behavior and the adoption of new technologies, and particularly provide insights about feasible directions for PUR.

PA-00N-88K,"In late 2010, theft of health commodities funded by health partners was discovered at the former Malawi Central Medical Stores (CMS).&nbsp; This angered health partners and they consequently pulled out of the CMS and established secure parallel supply chains (PSCs).&nbsp; This incidence, together with the reform measures already started, accelerated the establishment of the Central Medical Stores Trust (CMST), which was incorporated as a trust in August 2011.&nbsp; A Board of Trustees was established to provide oversight on CMST performance.&nbsp; In late 2012, a Joint Strategy for Integration of PSCs in Malawi was inaugurated.&nbsp; The Strategy outlined 36 preconditions (benchmarks) in four phases that the CMST must achieve prior to health partners' reconsidering integration of the PSCs in the country.&nbsp; CMST has been implementing the Joint Strategy benchmarks since 2013.&nbsp; In late 2015, CMST claimed to have achieved most of the benchmarks.&nbsp; This claim triggered the first independent assessment of the benchmarks conducted in February 2016.&nbsp; The assessment established that CMST had an overall achievement of 66 percent; classified as ""work in progress."" In October 2017, a reassessment of the benchmarks was conducted.&nbsp; Cumulatively, CMST achieved an overall score of 85 percent; a score considered indicative&nbsp; &nbsp;of CMST readiness to take up supply chain tasks currently being undertaken by PSCs.&nbsp; Importantly, this would require support from stakeholders to work on and achieve the remaining benchmarks as well to sustain what has been gained in the last five years of implementation of the 2012 Joint Integration Strategy.&nbsp; Consequent to these results and considering that to some extent integration of PSCs had already started (see main report), the current assessment key recommendations include: (1) PSC stakeholders should consider: (a) engaging the CMST to initiate the process for the preparation of a costed phased integration road map with realistic timelines; (b) long-term technical assistance to CMST, importantly, to support CMST to improve inventory management and stock accuracy; and (c) joint management and close oversight arrangement of CMST; and (2) CMST should review, prioritize, and implement recommendations of the two assessments by embedding them either in their corporate strategy or in integration road map/plans to be prepared jointly with stakeholders.&nbsp; (Author abstract)",Project title: Global health program cycle improvement (GH pro) ~|~_©_~|~ First evaluation: PA-00M-BPN,Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,,12/1/2017 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Commodities ~|~_©_~|~ Health commodities ~|~_©_~|~ Implementation ~|~_©_~|~ Supply chains ~|~_©_~|~ Transparency ~|~_©_~|~ Transportation planning ~|~_©_~|~ Tuberculosis,Malawi,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00N88K.pdf,1613 KB,040668 - Dexis Consulting Group,,"010496 - United Kingdom.

PA-00N-5VQ,"This evaluation is commissioned by the U.S. Agency for International Development in Bosnia and Herzegovina (USAID/BiH), in line with USAID's Evaluation Policy, to examine the 2010-2013 USAID/BiH Development Grants Program (DGP).&nbsp; The DGP's goal was to expand USAID's local NGO (LNGO) network of development partners and to provide capacity-building assistance to the new partners through supporting their initiatives.&nbsp; This performance evaluation answers six questions.&nbsp; The first three evaluation questions examine the nature of the USAID/BiH Mission's outreach and relationships with LNGOs in BiH and its post-DGP ability to directly partner with LNGOs in BiH.&nbsp; The remaining three questions examine how the work of the implementing LNGOs' sub-grantees was perceived and valued by end beneficiaries, whether the LNGOs' capacities changed as a result of their partnership with USAID, and whether they sustained their development efforts.&nbsp; The evaluation team employed a mixed-method approach.&nbsp; To address the evaluation questions, the evaluation team reviewed over 100 program implementation documents and databases and spoke with 143 interviewees.&nbsp; It found that DGP increased partnership opportunities for LNGOs and USAID/BiH Mission's ability to partner with nontraditional partners in the economic growth sector.&nbsp; However, further enlargement of direct partnering with LNGOs in the economic growth sector requires more funding opportunities for LNGOs' economic development initiatives and changes to the present approach of the Economic Development Office (EDO).&nbsp; The EDO's current activities are usually complex and large in terms of budget and scope and focus on achieving system level impacts rather than on increasing implementers' capacity.&nbsp; The DGP increased the implementing LNGOs' capacities to better meet their beneficiaries' needs, and the total number of end beneficiaries reached was substantial.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the achievements of the implemented activities were limited to the output level results.&nbsp; The weakest element of the Program was sustainability of the development efforts -- several organizations sustained their development efforts, but with significantly reduced scopes of work, or in sectors different than those supported by the DGP awards.&nbsp; The main evaluation recommendations for USAID/BiH's considerations (based on lessons learned from DGP and under the assumption that USAID/BiH chooses to continue expanding the LNGOs' network of development partners and providing capacity-building assistance to the new partners through supporting their initiatives in the economic growth sector) include: (1) increasing funding opportunities for LNGOs' economic development initiatives regardless of the funding source (USAID/BiH Mission's country budget in the economic development sector has so far not been used for LNGO prime awards); (2) matching funding levels for LNGOs to the level of their present absorption capacity and including implementers' program management and absorption capacity building in funded interventions' objectives, through gradual increase of amounts of awards to local prime NGO implementers as absorption capacity is built; (3) augmenting EDO's resources/resource division to ensure adequate resources to manage multiple awards to local prime NGO implementers and building of their capacities; (4) improving pre-award assessment tools and processes to focus more on technical and programmatic capacities of potential implementers in addition to financial and administrative capacities; and (5) improving the awards' risk management system.&nbsp; (Author abstract, modified)",Footer title: Evaluation of the 2010-2013 USAID/BIH DGP ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Bosnia and Herzegovina monitoring and evaluation support (MEASURE-BiH),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-168-C-14-00003,,11/1/2017 0:00,,Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Economic growth ~|~_©_~|~ Funding mechanisms ~|~_©_~|~ Local capacity building ~|~_©_~|~ Financial resources ~|~_©_~|~ Strategic objectives,Bosnia and Hercegovina,168-A-00-10-00105-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-168-A-00-10-00105 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-168-A-11-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-168-A-11-00005 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-168-F-13-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00N5VQ.pdf,1147 KB,"041024 - IMPAQ International, LLC",,009954 - USAID.

PA-00N-4JK,"The USAID/Nigeria-funded Family Health Plus (FH+) project implemented a three-pronged approach to increase the long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR).&nbsp; Managed by Marie Stopes International of Nigeria with partners Palladium Group (formerly Futures Group International) and Marie Stopes International, the three-year project ended in March 2017.&nbsp; It focused on training public health providers on LARC service delivery, advocacy to create an enabling environment, and demand and public awareness of LARC, and worked in 20 states in all geopolitical regions of Nigeria, training 2,124 providers in LARC and certifying more than 1,549 providers in LARC.&nbsp; The evaluation team visited public health facilities in three to four Local Government Areas in five states to observe LARC service delivery and to interview clients and providers.&nbsp; Stakeholders at the federal and state levels were also interviewed.&nbsp; Overall increase of LARC CPR during the project's period of performance was 1.5 percent.&nbsp; FH+ conducted the LARC training, but the quality of performance in facilities was found to be sub-par.&nbsp; The assessment focused on sustainability, cost effectiveness, quality of the training activities, and the value of the mobile District Health Information Software (DHIS) data collection system.&nbsp; Although the project's Advocacy component organized Advocacy Working Groups, it did not focus on creating an enabling environment to support LARC acceptance.&nbsp; Furthermore, demand creation was seldom conducted, nor did it occur regularly.&nbsp; Most of the budget was spent on training advocates in the working groups and LARC providers.&nbsp; Training activities had exceedingly high budgets and, compounded with the low quality of the LARC providers and Advocacy Working Groups, their effectiveness and the return on investment was low and not sustainable.&nbsp; (Author abstract)",Cover title: End-of-project evaluation of the Nigeria family health (FH+) project ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluation assignment number 401 ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Family health plus (FH+) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health program cycle improvement (GH pro),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,,9/1/2017 0:00,,Family health care ~|~_©_~|~ Contraceptive agents and devices ~|~_©_~|~ Contraceptive prevalence ~|~_©_~|~ Health workers ~|~_©_~|~ Enabling environment ~|~_©_~|~ Health delivery ~|~_©_~|~ Public awareness ~|~_©_~|~ Advocacy,,AID-620-A-14-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00N4JK.pdf,2669 KB,040668 - Dexis Consulting Group,,"008586 - USAID.

PA-00N-494,"This mid-term performance evaluation of USAID's West Africa Trade and Investment Hub (""WATIH"") addresses activities since the project started in March 2014, and answers three questions: (1) to what extent has WATIH achieved or is on track to achieve outcomes related to IR1 and IR2 and the respective sub-IRs in support of USAID's intended objectives?; (2) what are the benefits and trade-offs of having WATIH as a discrete mechanism for capacity building, value-chain support, and trade facilitation?; and (3) to what extent have selected partners supported through the USAID trade portfolio, including the ACA, GSA, and Borderless Alliance, become effective and sustainable regional institutions in terms of their organizational objectives? The evaluation team conducted qualitative interviews with 89 key public and private sector stakeholders across 12 countries, three focus group discussions, structured observations, and a review of project documents.&nbsp; The evaluation concluded that WATIH has made progress toward improving grades and standards and market information systems, but access to finance is lagging due to implementation capacity challenges and macroeconomic factors.&nbsp; Linkage events for buyers and sellers have not resulted in many executed deals despite the high attendance and popularity of these events.&nbsp; Many local stakeholders would prefer to have a direct relationship with USAID, but the coordination and administrative burdens of transferring the hub's reach to a series of direct partnerships would be prohibitive.&nbsp; USAID's support has been critical to the effectiveness of key regional organizations.&nbsp; However, many of these groups are reliant on donor funds and do not appear to be progressing toward sustainability.&nbsp; (Author abstract, modified)",Evaluated project title: West Africa trade and investment hub (WATIH) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: E3 analytics and evaluation,Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-M-13-00017,,10/1/2017 0:00,,International trade ~|~_©_~|~ Trade promotion ~|~_©_~|~ Access to credit ~|~_©_~|~ Financing ~|~_©_~|~ Investment ~|~_©_~|~ Staple foods ~|~_©_~|~ Management information systems ~|~_©_~|~ Value chains ~|~_©_~|~ Rural urban linkages ~|~_©_~|~ Farmers,West Africa,AID-624-C-13-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00N494.pdf,999 KB,"003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

PA-00N-3ZQ,"The United States Agency for International Development/Sri Lanka launched the Supporting Opportunities for Livelihoods Development (SOLID) activity in 2013 to increase economic opportunities for vulnerable families in target provinces of Sri Lanka.&nbsp; This mixed-methods, final-performance evaluation focuses on the following: (1) how effective SOLID was in achieving the project's intended outcomes; (2) whether project activities influenced USG and Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) relations; (3) if there were any intended or unintended effects on agricultural value chains and their sustainability; and (4) if, and how, beneficiaries are implementing skills and techniques taught by the project.&nbsp; Overall, SOLID improved agricultural output in all three of the target regions evaluated and in all three target sectors (dairy, horticulture, and poultry).&nbsp; This output was achieved in part by deploying effective techniques and technologies derived from commercial value chains, such as silage.&nbsp; SOLID succeeded in engaging women in agriculture and in providing access to productive assets, but SOLID's success was more mixed with respect to engaging youth.&nbsp; SOLID significantly improved household income and generated positive changes in household nutrition due to increased income generated by farming activities.&nbsp; The relationship between SOLID and the GoSL was characterized more by coordination and support, with limited influence on relevant GoSL activities and approaches.&nbsp; SOLID had limited partnerships with previous USG projects/activities and with other donors working in this space.&nbsp; Finally, the vast majority of past beneficiaries are currently implementing the skills and techniques promoted by SOLID, and most farmers involved in demonstration activities have adopted recommended practices.&nbsp; (Author abstract)",Evaluated task order title: Supporting opportunities for livelihoods development (SOLID) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: USAID Asia learning and M&E support ~|~_©_~|~ Project title also known as: Asia learning and monitoring and evaluation (ALME),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-383-TO-17-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-486-I-14-00001,,10/1/2017 0:00,,Livelihood ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Employment ~|~_©_~|~ Income generation ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural economics ~|~_©_~|~ Value chains ~|~_©_~|~ Dairy farms ~|~_©_~|~ Horticulture ~|~_©_~|~ Poultry ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural development,Sri Lanka,AID-OAA-M-12-00008,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00N3ZQ.pdf,1562 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008606 - USAID.

PA-00N-2QB,"The Global Health Program Cycle Improvement Project (GH Pro) conducted the mid-term evaluation of the seventh generation of the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Program, implemented by ICF International and partners.&nbsp; The Service Provision Assessment (SPA) is a health facility assessment that describes a country's health service delivery system.&nbsp; Twenty-four SPAs have been conducted in 15 countries since the SPA was added to the DHS Program in 1997.&nbsp; The evaluation's purpose was to assess how well the SPA is positioned ""to improve the collection, analysis, and presentation of population, health, and nutrition data and to facilitate use of these data for planning, policy-making, and program management.""&nbsp; The evaluation was guided by three questions: (1) what is the perceived value of SPA at global and country levels?; (2) how are SPA data being used at global and country levels?; and (3) what are USAID's and ICF's perceptions about opportunities and challenges facilitating SPA implementation? The evaluation design was largely qualitative.&nbsp; The evaluation team conducted 77 interviews with 104 respondents, reviewed documents, and made country visits to Bangladesh and Kenya.&nbsp; The evaluation found that the SPA has a strong global reputation for producing comprehensive, high-quality information.&nbsp; However, few SPAs have been conducted and their number is not increasing, unlike the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) and Service Delivery Indicator (SDI) surveys.&nbsp; The level of investment in the SPA is inadequate in some areas, including the number of surveys conducted and the dissemination and use of results.&nbsp; The evaluation team recommends concerted action to strengthen the SPA initiative.&nbsp; (Author abstract)",Evaluated project title: Demographic and health surveys program (DHS program) (DHS-7) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health program cycle improvement (GH pro),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,,9/1/2017 0:00,,Health delivery ~|~_©_~|~ Nutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Health service utilization ~|~_©_~|~ Implementation ~|~_©_~|~ Health facilities ~|~_©_~|~ Health care coverage ~|~_©_~|~ Quality of care ~|~_©_~|~ Health outcomes,Africa south of Sahara ~|~_©_~|~ Bangladesh ~|~_©_~|~ Kenya,AID-OAA-C-13-00095,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00N2QB.pdf,1846 KB,040668 - Dexis Consulting Group,,"040224 - USAID.

In its winning proposal, Pathfinder summarized E2A as a project that ""will increase global support for the use of evidenced-base best practices (BPs) to improve FP/reproductive health (RH) service access and quality.""&nbsp; (Technical Approach, AID-OAA-A-11-00024, May 2011: p.1).&nbsp; This evaluation's scope of work focused on how E2A has performed in four areas: BPs, youth interventions, USAID's gender priorities, and exercising global/regional leadership, influence, and partnership.&nbsp; This report centers on evaluation team responses to these questions.&nbsp; Data analyzed to formulate responses came from reviewing 75 documents, 70 key informant interviews, and visits to Niger, Tanzania, and Togo.&nbsp; Given the wide range of BPs, E2A focused on just a few to get started, gaining momentum as more Missions learned about the project.&nbsp; It is currently well-positioned, under a three-year extension, to continue making contributions at country, regional, and global levels.&nbsp; Over time, field support funding increased to a level approaching E2A's $230 million ceiling.&nbsp; To date, the project has fielded and generated evidence on BPs in 15 sub-Saharan countries, including expanding method mix in Burundi, Ethiopia, Nigeria, and Tanzania; post-abortion care/FP in Burkina Faso and Togo; youth-friendly services in Ethiopia, Niger, Cameroon, Nigeria, and Tanzania; the Training Resource Package in pre-service midwifery education in Uganda and Tanzania; and population, health, and environment in Uganda and Kenya.&nbsp; In its remaining years, E2A will continue to apply, advance, scale up, and generate and consolidate evidence and share the learning on these and other BPs.&nbsp; (Author abstract)",Evaluation assignment number: 314 ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Evidence to action (E2A) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health program cycle improvement (GH pro),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,,8/1/2017 0:00,,Family planning ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Reproductive health ~|~_©_~|~ Quality of care ~|~_©_~|~ Gender equality ~|~_©_~|~ Youth ~|~_©_~|~ Community health workers ~|~_©_~|~ Sex education ~|~_©_~|~ Family planning services,Africa south of Sahara ~|~_©_~|~ West Africa ~|~_©_~|~ East Africa,AID-OAA-A-11-00024,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00N2PS.pdf,1611 KB,040668 - Dexis Consulting Group,,"040224 - USAID.

PA-00N-1HJ,"The Office of Forestry and Biodiversity in the United States Agency for International Development's (USAID's) Bureau for Economic Growth, Education, and Environment commissioned a midterm performance evaluation of USAID's Measuring Impact (MI) activity. &nbsp;MI is a six-year contract that helps strengthen the capacity of Agency staff and enhance the evidence base by providing technical assistance (TA) and tools to foster adaptive management of biodiversity programming. &nbsp;The evaluation sought to examine activity achievements towards mainstreaming best practices for adaptive management and evidence-based decision-making at each stage of the program cycle, in compliance with the Agency's Biodiversity Policy. &nbsp;The evaluation employed a mixed-methods participatory approach using both qualitative and quantitative methods to address five evaluation questions. &nbsp;The evaluation concluded that MI has furthered USAID's capacity and appreciation for implementing processes for adaptive management in biodiversity programming. &nbsp;This success is due to the flexibility, adaptable framework, stakeholder engagement, and demand-driven model of MI tools and TA that allow for engagement at the various stages of USAID's program cycle. &nbsp;MI has also effectively promoted the use of an analytical framework for incorporating evidence into programming, monitoring, evaluation, and learning purposes. &nbsp;The activity has also had an effect at the Agency policy level on the use of evidence in programming, although findings on missions' utilization of evidence are less conclusive. &nbsp;The evaluation provides recommendations for further dissemination of tools and technical approaches and continued engagement with Agency operating units, including nurturing cross-mission learning, to help institutionalize achievements in adaptive management and biodiversity programming. &nbsp;(Author abstract)","""March 26, 2017 (Revised July 19, 2017)"" ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Measuring impact (MI) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: E3 analytics and evaluation",Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-M-13-00017,,7/1/2017 0:00,,Forestry ~|~_©_~|~ Biological diversity ~|~_©_~|~ Natural resource conservation ~|~_©_~|~ Resilience ~|~_©_~|~ Ecosystems,,AID-OAA-C-12-00078,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00N1HJ.pdf,756 KB,"003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

PA-00M-ZW2,"This qualitative midterm evaluation of the Maternal and Child Survival Program (MCSP), a five-year global program (March 2014 &ndash; March 2019), was conducted to provide the U.S. Agency for International Development's (USAID) Global Health Bureau's Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition Office (MCHN) with an assessment of the progress of its flagship program, to make recommendations to improve implementation of the current program, and to inform follow-on award design. &nbsp;Methods used were document review, in-depth interviews with key informants using structured guides, and a semi-structured electronic survey distributed to MCSP's supporting Missions and their in-country programs. &nbsp;USAID and MCSP chose the informants. &nbsp;Interviews were coded, and themes were identified with reference to the evaluation questions. &nbsp;Based on the qualitative analysis of the responses, the evaluation concluded that informants consistently recognized the technical excellence and leadership of MCSP global and national staff in working with client countries and global stakeholders. &nbsp;Informants also reported that MCSP's support for scale-up of high-impact interventions was complementary to their work in quality improvement. &nbsp;In most instances, MCSP was perceived to be maximizing opportunities for comprehensive reproductive maternal neonatal child health (RMNCH) platforms. &nbsp;At the global level, evaluation respondents have cited the significance of MCSP's technical guidance to the formulation of global RMNCH policies and guidelines. &nbsp;Recommendations for the program's remaining 18 months include a call for MCSP to focus its reporting efforts on finding compelling ways to present aggregated quantitative data from across multiple countries in order to further demonstrate MCSP's progress toward achieving its overall goals and objectives. &nbsp;(Author abstract)",Evaluation assignment number: 341 ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Maternal and child survival program (MCSP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health program cycle improvement (GH pro),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,,8/1/2017 0:00,,Maternal child health care ~|~_©_~|~ Child survival activities ~|~_©_~|~ Reproductive health ~|~_©_~|~ Postnatal nutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Health care coverage ~|~_©_~|~ Quality of care ~|~_©_~|~ Health policy ~|~_©_~|~ Community leadership ~|~_©_~|~ Health outcomes,Africa south of Sahara ~|~_©_~|~ East Africa ~|~_©_~|~ Southern Africa,AID-OAA-A-14-00028,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MZW2.pdf,2523 KB,040668 - Dexis Consulting Group,,"040224 - USAID.

PA-00M-ZJ3,"This report is a performance evaluation of the Incident Command System (ICS) program in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand managed by the United States Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA). &nbsp;The evaluation examined the program's effectiveness and sustainability in building the capacity of local government agencies in the three countries to respond to natural disaster using ICS. &nbsp;The evaluation applied a mixed methods design, collecting data from document reviews, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and an online survey for ICS master trainers in the Philippines. &nbsp;Results show that the programs have identified the appropriate local government agencies to work with and ICS capacities are being built to varying degrees. &nbsp;Demand for training is high but USAID/OFDA and the United States Forest Service (USFS) trainers must consider contextualizing ICS principles and training content to make the system relevant to local agencies and communities. &nbsp;USAID/OFDA and USFS trainers also should consider conditions unique to each country, such as governance structures, to solicit the support of the local first responders' community. &nbsp;The effectiveness and sustainability will also be better understood if local government agencies develop performance management plans to track the program's effectiveness and sustainability. &nbsp;(Author abstract)","A Performance Evaluation of the ICS System in Thailand Covering the Assistance Provided by USAID/OFDA from 2011 ~|~_©_~|~ Also known as: USAID OFDA ICS final evaluation report ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) ~|~_©_~|~ Indonesia country report: PA-00M-ZHZ ~|~_©_~|~ Philippines country report: PA-00M-ZJ1 ~|~_©_~|~ Thailand country report: PA-00M-ZJ2",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-TO-16-00037 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-15-00018,,8/1/2017 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Disaster management ~|~_©_~|~ Disaster response ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Knowledge ~|~_©_~|~ Local level ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion ~|~_©_~|~ Trainees,Thailand ~|~_©_~|~ Philippines ~|~_©_~|~ Indonesia,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MZJ3.pdf,1597 KB,"009054 - DevTech Systems, Inc.",,"000624 - USAID.

PA-00M-Z6B,"Since its creation in 2009, USAID's rule of law program in Haiti, PROJUSTICE, has worked to enhance justice delivery as a basis for establishing stability and security and improving citizens' confidence in Haitian government institutions.&nbsp; One activity of this program has been the provision of legal assistance in order to reduce the rate of prolonged pre-trial detention (PTD) in Haitian prisons.&nbsp; Prolonged PTD constitutes a prevalent human rights abuse in Haiti: over 70% of individuals in Haitian prisons are held in this illegal form of detention.&nbsp; This impact evaluation seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of PROJUSTICE's legal assistance program in prisons in Port au Prince and Croix des Bouquets.&nbsp; Given the large populations of pre-trial detainees in these jurisdictions, PROJUSTICE legal assistants will be unable to provide assistance to all detainees before the expiration of the program in 2016.&nbsp; By randomizing the order in which legal assistance is provided to current pre-trial detainees, we will be able to estimate the causal impact of PROJUSTICE legal assistance on the trajectory of the cases of those subjects held in prolonged PTD and quantify the impact of legal assistance on rates of PTD in Haiti.&nbsp; We also intend to track a number of secondary outcomes through baseline and endline surveys.&nbsp; Overall, the results from this impact evaluation will be of interest to local stake holders in civil society and the government, such as the Ministry of Justice and the Superior Council of the Judiciary (CSPJ), in addition to the academic community and the many human rights advocate, monitoring groups, and NGOs that work on similar issues of justice internationally.&nbsp; (Author abstract)","""Contract No. GS-10F-0033M/AID-OAA-M-13-00013"" ~|~_©_~|~ Tasking 031 ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Improving justice service delivery and sector reform in Haiti (PROJUSTICE) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: DRG learning, evaluation, and research (DRG-LER)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-M-13-00013,,4/1/2017 0:00,,Households ~|~_©_~|~ Lawyers ~|~_©_~|~ Litigation ~|~_©_~|~ Ports ~|~_©_~|~ Prisons ~|~_©_~|~ Socioeconomic status ~|~_©_~|~ Subjects (experimental) ~|~_©_~|~ Surveys,Haiti,521-C-00-09-00018-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-521-C-00-09-00018,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MZ6B.pdf,1490 KB,040818 - NORC at the University of Chicago,,"Project title: DRG learning, evaluation, and research (DRG-LER)",English,application/pdf,,,"Slough, Tara ~|~_©_~|~ Fariss, Christopher",Rule of law,21-Apr-17,,,,Impact evaluation of USAID Haiti PROJUSTICE program pretrial detention component,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MjMxODQ2,Haiti,,,2017-04-01,2017,HTI,HTI_2017,0.043036851837010004,0.5077883011933879,0.8254963427377221,,,0.111111111111111,,0.16518898140637697,0.087598471135695,0.128254143783861,0.27014755959137304,,,0.651299909729467,0.396324100440073,0.25925925925925897,0.582116788321168,HTI,2017,2.0,0.280547282260147,3.0,0.37498362989225276,PAK_2013,PAK_2017,BGD_2016,PAK_2016,PAK_2018

PA-00M-XVM,"This report presents the results of a final performance evaluation of the Partnership for Growth (PFG) in El Salvador, a shared development framework promoting economic growth. &nbsp;The evaluation used desk review and interview data to answer three questions: (1) what has been the overall impact of PFG in El Salvador, and how did the various lines of action contribute to this outcome?; (2) how did the PFG approach affect the bilateral relationship -- including U.S. Government (USG) and Government of El Salvador program implementation and dialogue -- in each partner country, both in intended and unintended ways?; (3) what best practices and lessons can be learned from the PFG approach to: (a) apply to the bilateral relationship in El Salvador and (b) apply to future USG assistance efforts worldwide? The evaluation team concludes that PFG enabled legislative reform, established new institutions, and supported international agreements. &nbsp;PFG's approach strengthened bilateral cooperation, improved trust, and directed greater attention to priority issues. &nbsp;Challenges included the lack of new funding and an excessive number of goals. &nbsp;There were mixed opinions on the scorecard completion process, and concern that PFG was overly optimistic regarding its potential for effecting change. &nbsp;The evaluation recommends that U.S. participation in the Growth Council continue, and the council expand to include other actors. &nbsp;Future multiagency collaborations of this type should empower leadership at the highest levels, and include more coordination resources and centralized recordkeeping. &nbsp;Similar activities should include the host government at the planning and reporting stages to encourage higher levels of participation. &nbsp;(Author abstract, modified)","""March 20, 2017 (Revised July 24, 2017)"" ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: E3 analytics and evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Spanish ed.: PA-00N-1HH ~|~_©_~|~ Mid-term evaluation: PA-00K-B8W",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-M-13-00017,,7/1/2017 0:00,,Economic growth ~|~_©_~|~ Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Policy reform ~|~_©_~|~ Constraints ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Business formation ~|~_©_~|~ Business growth ~|~_©_~|~ Development assistance,El Salvador,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MXVM.pdf,712 KB,"003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

PA-00M-SXM,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/Pacific Islands launched its Global Climate Change portfolio in 2011 in response to growing climate concerns. &nbsp;In 2016, Social Impact, Inc. conducted a performance evaluation on four of 11 portfolio activities (Coastal Community Adaptation Project, Pacific-American Climate Fund, Vegetation and Land Cover Mapping and Improving Food Security, and Climate Change Adaptation Program) across four of 12 portfolio countries (Fiji, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, and Papua New Guinea). &nbsp;The evaluation included a desk review and five weeks of mixed-methods data collection. &nbsp;Individually, the activities showed varying degrees of effectiveness in promoting climate change adaptation. &nbsp;Data from key informants and focus groups suggest that community-based activities with ongoing engagement showed the greatest promise in improving climate resilience. &nbsp;Activities with shorter timelines or insufficient resources were less likely to achieve positive impacts. &nbsp;Across the activities, some 60,000 persons will benefit from climate adaptive infrastructure, 24 civil society organizations (CSOs) will have improved implementation capacity, and regional partnerships may increase donor effectiveness. &nbsp;At the portfolio level, the lack of integration across activities inhibited programmatic synergies. &nbsp;Activities were not designed in a closely coordinated manner and close start dates left little time to conduct systematic planning. &nbsp;The evaluation team's recommendations include: (1) current portfolio activities should include a focus on capacity building for subnational (local and provincial) institutions and government; (2) USAID should continue community-based support and maximize the investment made in building a network of high-capacity CSO implementers; and (3) USAID should make funds available for longer periods of performance to increase sustainability. &nbsp;(Author abstract, modified)",At head of title: Evaluation report ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Vegetation and land cover mapping and improving food security for building resilience ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title:  Climate change adaptation program ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Coastal community adaptation project (C-CAP) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Pacific-American climate fund (PACAM) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: USAID Asia learning and M&E support ~|~_©_~|~ Project title also known as: Asia learning and monitoring and evaluation (ALME),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-492-TO-16-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-486-I-14-00001,,3/1/2017 0:00,,Climate change ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural adaptation ~|~_©_~|~ Community based delivery ~|~_©_~|~ Resilience ~|~_©_~|~ Behavior change ~|~_©_~|~ Integrated coastal management ~|~_©_~|~ Water supply ~|~_©_~|~ Disaster mitigation ~|~_©_~|~ Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Economic impact,,AID-ASIA-IO-11-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-ASIA-IO-11-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-492-C-12-00010 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-492-C-13-00017,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MSXM.pdf,3386 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008592 - USAID.

PA-00M-R5Q,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/Tanzania established the Tibu Homa project to: (1) increase availability and accessibility of fundamental facility-based curative and preventive child health services; (2) ensure sustainability of critical child health activities; and (3) increase linkages with the community to promote healthy behaviors and increase knowledge and use of child health services.&nbsp; Tibu Homa's components were training for healthcare workers on integrated management of childhood illnesses (IMCI), quality improvement, supply chain management, and supportive supervision and mentorship.&nbsp; MEASURE Evaluation was asked to conduct a performance evaluation to estimate the association between (1) the training modalities and (2) supportive components implemented by the Tibu Homa project with quality of care (QOC).&nbsp; The evaluation used a retrospective, mixed-methods approach drawing from a cross-sectional quantitative health facility survey, qualitative and costing data collection, secondary time series data, and project document review.&nbsp; The IMCI score was the primary outcome of the study.&nbsp; Evaluation results indicate the training modality was not associated with different levels of QOC as measured by the IMCI score.&nbsp; The QOC on this measure improved significantly over the course of the project regardless of training modality, but dropped by the time of follow-up.&nbsp; One year after the project ended, Tibu Homa facilities had higher QOC for all cases measured by the IMCI score, and higher rates of correct classification and treatment for pneumonia cases than did a group of comparison facilities.&nbsp; Both Tibu Homa and comparison facilities performed well on accurate classification and treatment of malaria cases.&nbsp; (Author abstract)",Footer title: Tibu homa project performance evaluation report ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Tibu homa ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: MEASURE evaluation phase IV,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-L-14-00004,,5/1/2017 0:00,,Child survival activities ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Child health care ~|~_©_~|~ Health behavior ~|~_©_~|~ Health workers ~|~_©_~|~ Integrated management ~|~_©_~|~ Pneumonia ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services,Tanzania,AID-621-A-00-11-00011 ~|~_©_~|~ 621-A-00-11-00011-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MR5Q.pdf,2345 KB,000821 - University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

PA-00M-PKN,"The Expanded Social Marketing Project in Nigeria (ESMPIN) is a five-year social marketing project funded by USAID/Nigeria to reduce maternal, and child morbidity and mortality and increase affordable family planning modern methods to Nigeria couples. &nbsp;The evaluation focuses on five questions: effectiveness of strategies, sustainability of strategies, evaluation of results, cost analysis, and gender conducted under the program. &nbsp;ESMPN is managed by The Society for Family Health (SFH), a Nigerian non-governmental organization that has implemented social marketing programs in Nigeria since the 1990s. &nbsp;Its partners for this award are Population Services International (PSI), British Broadcasting Corporation Media Action, and the Association of Reproductive and Family Health (ARFH), and the project worked in 22 states in Nigeria. &nbsp;ESMPIN was successful in building commodity-security, showing a reduction in stock-out rate from 30% to 15%. &nbsp;Although the program invested heavily in independent detailing and distribution networks, these are not sustainable operations without heavy funding from donors or outside sources. &nbsp;Cost analysis and primary research show the return on investment for the interpersonal communication agents in the South to be very low at about 2%, costing $3.321 million per Cycle (180 communities). &nbsp;ESMPIN conducted several pilot programs, including one with chemists, Proprietary Patent Medicine Vendors, and a public-private partnership with the Chi Pharmaceutical Ltd., manufacturer of an oral rehydration solution and Zinc. &nbsp;After $57 million and almost six years of implementation, Couple Years of Protection (CYPs) in 2011 for medium- and long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, (e.g., implants injectables, and IUDs) were 28.2% of the baseline CYP while over the five-year time frame by the end of ESMPIN (2016) the CYPs for these same products had increased only 0.1% to 28.3% CYPs. &nbsp;(Author abstract)",Evaluation assignment number: 246 ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Expanded social marketing project in Nigeria (ESMPIN) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health program cycle improvement (GH pro),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,,3/1/2017 0:00,,Social marketing ~|~_©_~|~ Family planning services ~|~_©_~|~ Health care costs ~|~_©_~|~ Gender equality ~|~_©_~|~ Investment promotion ~|~_©_~|~ Distribution ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Reproductive health,Nigeria,AID-620-A-11-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MPKN.pdf,2067 KB,040668 - Dexis Consulting Group,,"040224 - USAID.

PA-00M-PG7,"The HIV/AIDS Partnership: Impact through Prevention, Private Sector and Evidence-based Programming (PIPPSE) was a five-year project funded by USAID/India, designed to support national efforts in preventing HIV in India through institution strengthening and innovative approaches targeting the general population, key populations (KPs), and priority populations (PPs). &nbsp;Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) served as the Prime partner with sub-partners, Futures Group International India Pvt Ltd (Futures) and Population Services International (PSI). &nbsp;The project was modified in Year 3 to reflect a revised PEPFAR focus on KPs and PPs and reduced funding. &nbsp;The evaluation focused on: implementation of the District Network Model (DNM); effectiveness of institutional and human capacity building, private sector engagement, information technology, and data management systems; PHFI's role as a Prime partner; and lessons for future program design. &nbsp;The evaluation team reviewed reports and designed a mixed methods study, with 50 key informant interviews and seven focus group discussions. &nbsp;The project was found to be generally effective, despite significant early delays and management issues. &nbsp;The DNM approach was found to be effective in reaching KPs and PPs, linking them to services, and achieving saturation coverage targets. &nbsp;Eight state training programs improved skills for targeted interventions, and information technology and data management systems were adopted nationally. &nbsp;The successful Public-Private Partnership Employer-Led Model rolled out nationally, but models for physical and financial access to private providers were stalled. &nbsp;Recommendations include: adoption of innovative DNM strategies in future district activities, analysis of target intervention coverage of new entrants, development of test models for KP access to private providers, and early capacity building for new local partners. &nbsp;(Author abstract)","Footer title: Final performance evaluation of USAID/India PIPPSE ~|~_©_~|~ Also known as: PIPPSE evaluation report ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: HIV/AIDS partnership : impact through prevention, private sector and evidence-based programming (PIPPSE) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health program cycle improvement (GH pro)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,,3/1/2017 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Private sector ~|~_©_~|~ Health innovations ~|~_©_~|~ Human capacity development ~|~_©_~|~ Disease testing ~|~_©_~|~ Networks ~|~_©_~|~ Institutional linkages ~|~_©_~|~ Data quality ~|~_©_~|~ People living with AIDS (PLWA),India,AID-386-A-12-00003,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MPG7.pdf,2061 KB,040668 - Dexis Consulting Group,,"040224 - USAID.

Methods: Collection of qualitative data from interviews and focus groups with project implementers, clients and stakeholders; analysis of project indicator data; secondary data analysis; and document review. &nbsp;Key findings and conclusions: The redesign and implementation of HIV React Phase II has appropriately made the transition from general HIV prevention to HIV case detection and linking HIV-positive prisoners and ex-prisoners to HIV treatment, with adherence and retention support. &nbsp;ART uptake rates among eligible prisoners are generally high. &nbsp;There is qualitative evidence that post-release support has increased adherence rates. &nbsp;However, due to the recent transition in programming, there was insufficient data to determine the effectiveness of this transition. &nbsp;The project is also not collecting a sufficient range of data to measure its progress in achieving the 90-90-90 objectives. &nbsp;New indicators are needed along with a revised monitoring plan for the project. &nbsp;HIV React has facilitated improved collaboration between penal medical departments and AIDS Centers which improved the quality of care within prisons and reduced loss to follow-up on release. &nbsp;The peer model for education and support is operating effectively. &nbsp;There is a need for advocacy to governments on replication of the HIV React model in non-project sites. &nbsp;Key constraints include weak prison health systems which impact negatively on the quality of care; restrictions on the work of NGO implementing partners access to prisons; and the inability of the project to provide post-release treatment support to ex-prisoners who return to regions where the project is not working. &nbsp;(Author abstract, modified)",Evaluation assignment number: 295 ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: HIV REACT ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health program cycle improvement (GH pro),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,,3/1/2017 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Antiretroviral therapy ~|~_©_~|~ Prisons ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Disease detection,Tajikistan ~|~_©_~|~ Kazakhstan ~|~_©_~|~ Kyrgyzstan,AID-176-A-14-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MNRM.pdf,1898 KB,040668 - Dexis Consulting Group,,"040224 - USAID.

PA-00M-NMM,"The objectives of this final evaluation were to: (1) identify the contribution of the USAID supported Amazon Malaria Initiative (AMI) to the ability of eleven partner countries' National Malaria Control Programs to control malaria from 2001-2015; (2) evaluate the capabilities of partner countries to address the changing scenarios of malaria transmission; and, (3) identify the main challenges that countries may face while confronting new scenarios of malaria transmission as well as the challenges that should be addressed by international cooperation agencies.&nbsp; The evaluation used a mixed analytical approach incorporating qualitative and quantitative methods.&nbsp; The qualitative component included in-depth interviews with key informants, content analysis of selected documents, and case studies from four partner countries.&nbsp; The quantitative component included the analysis of data obtained from epidemiological databases on malaria and the review of selected documents.&nbsp; AMI partner countries have shown a substantial but heterogeneous reduction of malaria cases since the year 2001, including some setbacks and slower progress in later years, especially the last four.&nbsp; Partner countries have achieved substantial progress and developed important capabilities in all six of the AMI Program technical focus areas.&nbsp; AMI supported capacity development that addressed country-specific malaria control needs and scenarios.&nbsp; The program served as a platform for inter-country collaboration, introducing innovations and strengthening information systems through national communication strategies and alliances.&nbsp; Key capacities for malaria control have been built and enhanced, and these continue to respond to changing epidemiological scenarios.&nbsp; However, there is a need to make improvements, such as better planning and monitoring of activities including alignment to PAHO&acute;s strategy, in order to consolidate progress and prevent the reintroduction of malaria.&nbsp; The principal recommendation of this evaluation is to maintain the progress to date.&nbsp; Malaria elimination is still in the distant future, and it is more important to continue building strong programs, overcome current and upcoming crises and prevent re-emergence in settings where malaria is under control.&nbsp; The control of malaria is not exclusive to the national level, but instead requires a regional agenda meriting support from the international cooperation, as PAHO, in coordination with partner countries.&nbsp; (Author abstract)",Cover date: Diciembre 2016 ~|~_©_~|~ Translated title provided by submitter ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Amazon malaria initiative (AMI) ~|~_©_~|~ Mid-term evaluation (in English): PA-00K-8CZ,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-527-C-13-00002,,3/1/2017 0:00,,Malaria ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Disease treatment ~|~_©_~|~ Drug resistance ~|~_©_~|~ Antimalarials ~|~_©_~|~ Disease surveillance ~|~_©_~|~ Medical laboratories ~|~_©_~|~ Information dissemination ~|~_©_~|~ Morbidity,Latin America ~|~_©_~|~ Andean region ~|~_©_~|~ Central America,AID-527-A-12-00006,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MNMM.pdf,1998 KB,"013010 - Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH) ~|~_©_~|~ 040772 - Partners for Global Research and Development, LLC (PGRD)",,008591 - USAID.

PA-00M-KCG,"The Fistula Care Plus (FC+) Project is a five-year global project supported by the USAID Offices of Population and Reproductive Health, and Maternal and Child Health and Nutrition. &nbsp;The project is designed to prevent, detect, and treat obstetric fistula. &nbsp;The purpose of this evaluation is to identify strengths and weaknesses of the project, as well opportunities for fistula programming beyond the life of the current project, including: (1) the extent FC+ has supported country ownership of fistula programming; (2) contributions FC+ has made to global leadership, advancing research and innovation, and transferring new technologies to the field; (3) the effects of management changes on the project; and (4) if FC+ is on track to achieve its objectives. &nbsp;The evaluation used a mixed method approach, including document and indicator data review, surveys of USAID Mission staff and nurses involved in post-operative fistula care, interviews with key stakeholders, and focus groups with post-operative fistula patients. &nbsp;The evaluation found that the project has contributed significantly to country ownership, particularly related to detection, treatment, and prevention. &nbsp;FC+ plays a key role in global leadership on the issues of safe surgery, with a concern both for apparent increases in iatrogenic fistula and to improve fistula and prolapse surgical outcomes. &nbsp;Despite early changes in personnel, there was a smooth transition, and the project stakeholders stated they were unaffected by these changes. &nbsp;Furthermore, the project is on track to meet its objectives, but it could begin to build upon its strong model to expand its focus on causes and treatment of incontinence in women more broadly. &nbsp;(Author abstract)",Evaluated project title: Fistula care plus (FC+) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health program cycle improvement (GH pro),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,,2/1/2017 0:00,,Fistula ~|~_©_~|~ Obstetrics ~|~_©_~|~ Health innovations ~|~_©_~|~ Surgery ~|~_©_~|~ Health outcomes ~|~_©_~|~ Family planning services ~|~_©_~|~ Maternal health care,Bangladesh ~|~_©_~|~ Congo DR ~|~_©_~|~ Nigeria ~|~_©_~|~ Uganda,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MKCG.pdf,2219 KB,040668 - Dexis Consulting Group,,"040224 - USAID.

PA-00M-HCR,"This evaluation analyzes the contribution of the Peru Bosques Project (PPB) to the progress made in fulfilling the Environmental Chapter and the Forest Sector Governance Annex of the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA). &nbsp;The evaluation focuses specifically on: (1) contributions to the institutional strengthening of the forestry sector; (2) capacity building in forest management; (3) monitoring, control, and supervision of illegal logging; and (4) to the sustainable use of the forest by the private sector and indigenous communities. &nbsp;The evaluation employs a mixed-methods approach that includes primary qualitative data gathered in Lima, Madre de Dios, Loreto and Ucayali. &nbsp;Main findings suggest that the PPB contributed substantially to the consolidation of the institutional reforms in the forestry sector through three important results: (1) support for the creation and implementation of the National Forestry and Wildlife Service (SERFOR); (2) improvement to the viability of the prior consultation process for the new regulations for the Forestry and Wildlife Law; and (3) in the customized design of the Regional Environmental Authorities (ARAs) for the regional governments of Loreto, Madre de Dios, and Ucayali. &nbsp;The PPB intervened successfully with the private sector, which is a key ally in the fight against illegal logging and for the sustainable use of forests. &nbsp;The intervention involved the participation of indigenous organizations in the first regulatory consultation process and the training of community stakeholders to protect the forest. &nbsp;However, there is a lack of capacity building at the community level. &nbsp;Capacity building efforts among civil servants were hampered by a lack of political will and the slow implementation of the civil service law. &nbsp;The evaluation recommends: (1) strengthening the coordination and transparency functions of the governing body of the National Forestry and Wildlife System; (2) institutionalizing capacity building on environmental and forest management issues with regional governments; (3) promoting community forest management with indigenous organizations; and (4) promoting incentives within a value chain approach for the legalization and formalization of timber and non-timber forest activities. &nbsp;(Author abstract, modified)","""Ultima revision: Diciembre 28, 2016"" ~|~_©_~|~ Translated title provided by cataloguer ~|~_©_~|~ Abstract and executive summary also in English ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Proyecto Peru bosques  (PPB)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-527-C-13-00002,,11/1/2016 0:00,,Forestry ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Natural resource management ~|~_©_~|~ Monitoring ~|~_©_~|~ Logging ~|~_©_~|~ Sustainable development ~|~_©_~|~ Private sector ~|~_©_~|~ Indigenous populations ~|~_©_~|~ Local capacity building ~|~_©_~|~ Wildlife resources ~|~_©_~|~ Crime prevention ~|~_©_~|~ Incentives,Peru,AID-527-C-11-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MHCR.pdf,1253 KB,"012146 - Grupo de Analisis para el Desarrollo (GRADE) ~|~_©_~|~ 040772 - Partners for Global Research and Development, LLC (PGRD)",,008591 - USAID.

PB-AAF-123,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">This report evaluates the performance of the Climate Resiliency of Kazakhstan Wheat and Central Asian Food Security (CRW) project.&nbsp; The $2.2 million project was aimed at improving Kazakhstan's collection, analysis, dissemination and use of weather and climate information, including forecasting, and give farmers techniques to adapt to climate change.&nbsp; It also aimed to launch a regional dialogue on wheat, climate change and regional food security.&nbsp; Kazakhstan is a major wheat producer and the largest grain producer under predominantly rain-fed conditions in the world.&nbsp; Farmers are facing more droughts due to higher temperatures and more climate variability.&nbsp; The evaluation found mixed results in terms of improving the government's ability to collect and analyze agrometeorological data and making seasonal and climate predictions.&nbsp; As one example, the project has led to better drought, crop and climate assessments, but seasonal climate forecasts have seen only marginal gains.&nbsp; Regarding dissemination, it found few farmers receive monthly agricultural bulletins created by the Ministry of Agriculture.&nbsp; The fees required may impede this.&nbsp; The evaluation also covered whether farmers are adopting climate-resilient techniques and whether the project addressed key climate challenges and gender concerns.&nbsp; It listed 26 recommendations for subsequent projects and further steps the government could take.&nbsp; (ClimateLinks.org)&nbsp;</p>",Footer title: Final evaluation report - performance evaluation : CRW project ~|~_©_~|~ Also known as: Iimproving the climate resiliency of Kazakhstan wheat and Central Asian food security project : final performance evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: E3 analytics and evaluation,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-M-13-00017,,12/1/2015 0:00,,Climate change ~|~_©_~|~ Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Resilience ~|~_©_~|~ Weather ~|~_©_~|~ Farmers ~|~_©_~|~ Farmer training ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural innovations ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural adaptation ~|~_©_~|~ Wheat ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural production,Kazakhstan,AID-176-IO-14-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PBAAF123.pdf,2036 KB,"011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

PA-00W-5R8,"The Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) Reads Capacity Program (LRCP) is a six-year program initiated in 2014 with the purpose of increasing the impact, scale, and sustainability of early grade reading (EGR) interventions in the LAC region. LRCP provided ministries of education and other relevant stakeholders with the necessary awareness, knowledge, and tools to increase EGR achievement. LRCP has been implemented primarily in the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Jamaica, and Nicaragua. This performance evaluation was undertaken to inform midcourse adjustments in program implementation for the remainder of the LRCP and any possible extensions, as well as to inform ongoing and future regional and bilateral USAID programming. It addresses two questions: (1) How effective has the LRCP been in achieving its goals by result and by country to date? and (2) What are the strengths and weaknesses of the LRCP approach to catalyzing reading improvement through policy-level interventions? Quantitative and qualitative data gathered for the evaluation revealed that LRCP has consolidated and disseminated EGR research and resources from the LAC region, yet the use of them by key stakeholders remains limited. EGR building the capacity of ministry of education staff, teachers, members of NGOs, and other stakeholders was reported to be the most important LRCP contribution. Bases established for sustainability include a critical mass of EGR stakeholders, a momentum for EGR improvement, alliances, and a regional network for EGR research.",Evaluated project title: Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) reads capacity program (LRCP),Special Evaluation,Documents,GS-10F-0048L ~|~_©_~|~ 7200AA18M00024,,9/1/2019 0:00,,Databases ~|~_©_~|~ Life skills ~|~_©_~|~ Literacy ~|~_©_~|~ Managers ~|~_©_~|~ Networks ~|~_©_~|~ Questionnaires ~|~_©_~|~ Stakeholder analysis ~|~_©_~|~ Surveys,Latin America,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00W5R8.pdf,2065 KB,"013584 - SSG Advisors, LLC ~|~_©_~|~ 009054 - DevTech Systems, Inc.",,001373 - USAID.

PA-00W-5CV,"<div>USAID/Liberias Accelerated Quality Education for Liberian Children (AQE) activity, implemented by the Education Development Center, Inc. (EDC), is a $33.9 million, four-year activity from March 2017 to 2021, established to increase access to education for approximately 48,000 out-of-school children. Social Impact, Inc. (SI), conducted this midterm performance evaluation of AQE through Liberia Strategic Analysis (LSA) from May to August 2019, examining the following: (1) AQEs development hypothesis, which centers on institutionalization leading to improved teaching and safety and in turn supporting learners transitions to conventional schools; (2) access to education; (3) safety; (4) effects of class time allotted on learning; and (5) local actors, including government, that can support alternative education (AE) over the long term.<br /><br /></div> <div>AQE demonstrates several successes, particularly in developing high-quality teaching and learning materials. However, facilitators experienced challenges covering lessons from the packed AQE curriculum. To address this, the evaluation recommends that AQE extend literacy and numeracy sessions, while reducing science and life skills. Despite AQEs effective community engagement, hunger, farming, and many other factors still inhibit access to education. AQE schools also face barriers to safety, including unsafe roads and limited facilities. To support both access and safety, AQE can further engage Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs) and foster linkages with outside resources such as the police. Finally, collaboration with government is central to the AQE approach, yet this work is inconsistent; moving forward, AQE must share resources, jointly</div>",Evaluated task order title: Accelerated quality education (AQE) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Liberia strategic analysis (LSA),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-669-C-16-00002,,9/1/2019 0:00,,Access to education ~|~_©_~|~ Children ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Curriculum ~|~_©_~|~ Enrollment ~|~_©_~|~ Life skills ~|~_©_~|~ Sports ~|~_©_~|~ USAID,Liberia,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00W5CV.pdf,1431 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008570 - USAID.

PA-00W-5B9,"<div>This report presents findings and recommendations from the midterm performance evaluation of the Liberia Municipal Water Project II (LMWP II) and final performance evaluation of the Capital Improvement Project (CIP). LMWP II provides construction oversight and quality assurance for CIP, a separate USAID-funded activity, which involved the construction of water supply systems in three cities: Robertsport, Sanniquellie, and Voinjama. LMWP II also provides capacity building and direct support to the Liberia Water and Sewer Corporation (LWSC) to sustainably operate and manage the three systems.<br /><br /></div> <div>The evaluation examined infrastructure planning, construction and quality, capacity building, and cost sustainability. It found that the completion of the construction and hand-over to LWSC was delayed, yet the overall quality of the infrastructure generally conforms to design specifications and national standards. Under USAIDs accessibility criteria, LMWP II has nearly met its objective of providing access to improved water supply to 90 percent of the three cities population.<br /><br /></div> <div>At the midterm, LWSC is unable to take ownership for managing these systems and needs continued LMWP II capacity building and advocacy for buy-in and financial transparency to improve by the end of the activity. The water systems do not appear to be financially sustainable, mainly due to the fact that expected subsidies from the Government of Liberia (GOL), meant to support the LWSC, have not yet been disbursed, as was agreed upon in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between USAID and the GOL. To ensure financial sustainability, USAID should continue advocating for GOL to disburse LWSCs subsidies. The evaluation also recommends looking into funding and network expansion modalities to facilitate household and business connections or increase the distribution networks for improved revenue generation. With continued community awareness of these systems, these next steps will help USAID achieve its overall Development Objective of improving community health through access to clean water</div>","On title page: Submitted: January 10, 2019 ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order title: Municipal water project II (LMWP II) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Liberia strategic analysis (LSA)",Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-669-C-16-00002,,1/1/2019 0:00,,Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Consumers ~|~_©_~|~ Cost recovery ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Revenues ~|~_©_~|~ Subsidies ~|~_©_~|~ Water sanitation ~|~_©_~|~ Water supply,Liberia,AID-669-TO-16-00008 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-15-00052,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00W5B9.pdf,2613 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008570 - USAID.

PA-00W-4N6,"<div>This mid-term performance evaluation of the USAID Trade and Food Security Project (TFSP) addresses the following activities:</div> <div>1. The Southern Africa Trade and Investment Hub (SATIH)  launched September 2016</div> <div>2. The Seed Trade Project (STP)  launched September 2016</div> <div>3. The Trade Policy Initiative (TPI)  launched December 2013<br /><br /></div> <div>As the project was run as three distinct activities under a common Project Appraisal Document (PAD), project-level performance largely reflects the sum performance of the three activities.<br /><br /></div> <div>Although SATIH has met Y1 and Y2 targets for indicators such as value of exports and investment facilitated (notwithstanding the need for a significant ramp up in results to achieve LoP targets), in totality it has met just under half its indicator targets. Furthermore, the indicators provide an incomplete view of the overall performance. This reflects that they cover only a small proportion of the potential outputs and outcomes of the tasks undertaken. Where SATIH meets targets, this reflects a range of transaction-oriented successes in areas such as investment, exports, and grain trade. These successes, while important, have had weak contributions to the broader objectives of the activity. This reflects an insufficient systems view that led to upstream and downstream challenges reducing the scale of results, ineffective translation of transactional results into wider market systems changes, and, in some cases, the hubs decision to undertake projects with poor additionality. Management challenges also led to a lack of prioritization and exacerbated siloed working, further reducing the relevance of SATIH's activities.<br /><br /></div> <div>STPs performance against indicator targets has been weaker, although since the projects turnaround in 2017 STP has made steady progress in advancing a long-term Harmonized Seed Regulation System (HSRS) agenda and appears to have strong potential to reach LoP targets. Management changes enabled this improvementincluding the re-location of STP from Pretoria to Lusaka, which has help deepen crucial stakeholder relationships. The sustainability of STPs work poses a challenge, however, with additional work needed to fully embed HSRS across Southern Africa, some of which is beyond STPs current scope.<br /><br /></div> <div>As a cooperative agreement, TPI does not have LoP targets in the same form as the other two activities; nevertheless, TPI has earned the respect of stakeholders for the quality and usefulness of its efforts, and has largely fulfilled the scope of its work plan. Stakeholders report high application rate for knowledge gained from capacity building and policy dialogue interventions, while examples suggested TPIs research is used in highly impactful ways (although that impact often is not tracked). However, the initiatives effectiveness is reduced by insufficient government capacity to implement trade policy improvements; TPIs narrow audiencepredominantly government officials and researcherscompounds this challenge.<br /><br /></div> <div>These findings reflect the five evaluative themes this work exploresthe relevance of work delivered, management of activities and TFSP as a whole, sustainability of outcomes (equitableness and likelihood of survival past the LoP), best practices for future programming, and opportunities.<br /><br /></div> <div>To inform this work, the evaluation team conducted 128 qualitative semi-structured interviews with 154 interviewees, reviewed 77+ project documents and additional data sources gathered in meetings with project stakeholders, received 321 survey responses, and held 5 working sessions with USAID/REGO.</div>",On cover page: February - June 2019 ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Trade and food security project (TFSP),Special Evaluation,Documents,GS-10F-0188V ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-M-14-00018,,6/1/2019 0:00,,Corporations ~|~_©_~|~ Demonstration ~|~_©_~|~ Food ~|~_©_~|~ Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Investment ~|~_©_~|~ Mutual funds ~|~_©_~|~ Seeds ~|~_©_~|~ Trade,Southern Africa,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00W4N6.pdf,1941 KB,"041228 - Dalberg Consulting-U.S., LLC",,013469 - USAID.

PA-00W-4BW,"<div>USAID-funded Strengthening High Impact Interventions for an AIDS-free Generation (AIDSFree) Project, works to scale-up Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC) in high HIV prevalence countries. This evaluation examined VMMC-associated adverse events (AEs), AE documentation, reporting and management practices, and mechanisms for identifying, reporting, and preventing AEs in three AIDSFree countries: Malawi, Namibia, and Tanzania. In Namibia and Tanzania, data on VMMC AEs were abstracted from medical records in clinics supported by AIDSFree. In all three countries key informant interviews were conducted and project documents were reviewed. In Namibia, medical records were found to be largely complete, but in Tanzania that data quality and chart completeness varied considerably. There was underreporting of moderate and severe AEs in both countries. Interview respondents in Malawi, Namibia, and Tanzania understood AE reporting and documentation mechanisms, but respondents in all three countries voiced concern that reporting of AEs might exclude them from future VMMC work. Prevention strategies focused on postoperative AEs, as patients often have limited understanding of wound care and hygiene, despite extensive counseling. Risk factor analysis was limited to Namibia over concerns of data quality in Tanzania. In Namibia, postoperative AEs were twice as likely as intraoperative AEs and the highest postoperative AE rate was observed among 15- to 24-year-olds.<br /><br /></div> <div>Recommendations included:</div> <div> Training of clinic staff should emphasize appropriate documentation and charting of AEs, along with VMMC clinical skills and AE management.</div> <div> VMMC implementing partners should conduct routine data quality assessment with data validation to improve documentation.</div> <div> Increased emphasis should be placed on postoperative wound management, care, and hygiene</div>",Evaluated task order title: AIDS-free generation (AIDSFree) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global Health Program Cycle Improvement Project (GH Pro),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,,9/1/2019 0:00,,AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Age ~|~_©_~|~ Circumcision ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Documentation ~|~_©_~|~ Hygiene ~|~_©_~|~ Infections ~|~_©_~|~ Male,Namibia ~|~_©_~|~ Tanzania ~|~_©_~|~ Malawi,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00W4BW.pdf,2839 KB,"011976 - QED Group, LLC ~|~_©_~|~ 040668 - Dexis Consulting Group",,010929 - USAID.

PA-00T-PZ8,"In 2016, USAID initiated a three-year, multi-country health emergency response to Zika and the negative pregnancy outcomes of the virus in Latin America and the Caribbean. This performance evaluation used a mixed-methods approach and comes in the final year of the response. It focuses on understanding the enablers and limitations addressed, accomplishments in strengthening systems in countries, and how the response was managed. The evaluation also reviews USAIDs initial decisionmaking process and the various implementation levelsregional, national, and subnational/communityengaged during implementation. <br /><br />Using experienced organizations and evidence-based approaches under a tight timeframe, USAID assisted governments in integrating Zika into existing arbovirus programs, establishing specialized training in entomology, and tracking insecticide resistance. The Zika response introduced a Quality Improvement approach into prenatal, pregnancy, delivery, and neonatal care for Zika, and brought men in as partners in Zika prevention prior to and during pregnancy. This assistance appears to have facilitated the absorption of innovations and strengthened partner country ability to better respond to Zika in the future. <br /><br />Recommendations at this juncture include suggestions for effective close-out at the country level and for providing future access to the experience and technical materials prepared under the response. For the future, it is also recommended that USAID align contracting and budgeting elements with the needs of health emergency responses, and review management structures for rapid response within the Bureau for Global Health.",,Special Evaluation,Documents,,,2/1/2019 0:00,,,,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TPZ8.pdf,2826 KB,,,,,,,,,Disease prevention and control,Feb-19,,,,Performance evaluation of USAIDs Zika response in the Latin America and Caribbean (LAC) region,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=NTUxMjE1,,,,2019-02-01,2019,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PA-00T-XWW,"Social Impact, Inc. conducted an ex-post performance evaluation of the Mai Munisipiu Program (MMP), implemented in Timor-Leste by Counterpart International. The purpose of the evaluation was to explore how sustainable results have been since the programs conclusion in 2017. The evaluation questions addressed the extent to which Suco (village) councils, legal aid organizations, and district courts retained skills from MMP training; outcomes in human and institutional capacity of Suco councils; whether the design of MMP was appropriate for the countrys context; and the extent to which community members agree that women can be effective leaders. The evaluation included a document review; 45 semi-structured key informant interviews; four focus group discussions; and a rapid survey of 50 citizens. <br /><br />The evaluation concluded: Suco councils retained proposal writing skills. The comprehensiveness of the training curriculum and follow-up mentoring facilitated retention; Suco councils improved their administration, but equivalent gains were not made in other areas. The turnover of elected council members after elections in 2016 is a threat to the sustainability of the capacity that was built; community members believe that women can be effective leaders in theory, but in practice they prefer male leaders; court and legal aid actors retained little from the training due to their base capacity level and the limited volume of training provided; and program efforts did not result in an increase in basic services to citizens, but they laid a foundation that can be built upon.",Evaluated task order title: Mai munisipiu program (MMP) formerly known as ba distrito (to the districts) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: USAID Asia learning and monitoring &evaluation support,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-486-I-14-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ 72047219F00001,,7/1/2019 0:00,,Courts ~|~_©_~|~ Elections ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Judicial reform ~|~_©_~|~ Local level ~|~_©_~|~ Political participation ~|~_©_~|~ Voting ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Timor-Leste,AID-486-A-13-00007,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TXWW.pdf,1455 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,011939 - USAID.

PA-00T-XVR,"<p class=""p1"">The USAID-supported Mayer Hashi Phase II (MH-II) project, implemented during October 2013 through September 2018 aimed to increase the use of effective family planning (FP) and reproductive health services, with a focus on the informed and voluntary use of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) and permanent methods (PMs). This external impact evaluation was conducted by MEASURE Evaluation to determine the impact of the MH-II project on LARC and PM use at the population level. The evaluation used household, provider, and facility surveys conducted in 2015 and 2017 in early (Phase I) and late (Phase III) implementation districts supplemented by qualitative interviews with district family planning managers in 2017 to contextualize results.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class=""p1"">There were no increases in LARC and PM use or in intention to use LARCs and PMs at the population level in Mayer Hashi Phase I or Phase III program areas by 2017. The percentage of providers who were trained in LARCs and PMs and PPFP increased notably in both Phase I and Phase III areas, but changes in intermediate outcomes hypothesized along the program pathway were not realized. Contextual analysis identified chronic system weaknesses in provision of LARCs and PMs outside of the scope of the MH-II project and persistent low demand for LARCs and PMs as impediments to widespread increases in the use of LARCs and PMs. Future programs focusing on LARCs and PMs need to consider these larger system constraints in their design and in setting their expected outcomes. They also need to further engage the private sector given its growing role in health care.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p>",Evaluated task order title: Mayer hashi II ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: MEASURE evaluation phase II,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-L-14-00004,,8/1/2019 0:00,,Age ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Family health care ~|~_©_~|~ Planning ~|~_©_~|~ Questionnaires ~|~_©_~|~ Reproduction ~|~_©_~|~ Surveys ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Bangladesh,AID-388-LA-13-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TXVR.pdf,7698 KB,000891 - University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,,010929 - USAID.

This</div> <div>framework became self-sustaining and can be replicated in other countries. The original goal of creating an</div> <div>institution that would become a single national bond bank was set aside.

Two state bond banks were created, in Hidalgo and Quintana</div> <div>Roo. The capacity building goal was partially completed. High personnel turnover at the local government level,</div> <div>when national government administrations change, is a constraint for creating a sustained workforce of staff</div> <div>trained in the use of the tool. The work of the last years of the activity restructured the debt for the state of</div> <div>Veracruz and introduced a new special purpose financing vehicle, the Accredited Trust.

PA-00T-X21,"<div>With support from the United States Agency for International Development, and in partnership with the South Africa Department of Basic Education, MEASURE Evaluation is conducting an impact evaluation of the implementation of scripted lesson plans (SLP) and supporting activities developed to increase the rigor and uniformity of a life skills program for in-school youth. The evaluation aims to describe the effect of the SLP on herpes simplex virus 2 incidence or change in prevalence of pregnancy among a cohort of Grade-8 female learners as they progress to Grade 10. Secondarily, this evaluation aims to describe the programs effects on knowledge, attitudes, school retention, self-reported risk behavior, HIV testing, and completed referrals for health services among the cohort of Grade-8 female learners and cross-sections of male learners in Grades 8, 9, and 10.<br /><br /></div> <div>The evaluation employed a two-arm, stratified, cluster-randomized design. Grade-8 females, Grade-8 males, and Grade-10 females (n=10,133) enrolled in 106 schools were surveyed. Baseline data were collected in AugustOctober 2016. Sampling weights were applied to compute descriptive statistics and frequency distributions of all variables.<br /><br /></div> <div>Few differences were observed between the intervention and control groups. Most young people valued and appreciated what they were learning in their Life Orientation curriculum, but gaps emerged in their knowledge of HIV and AIDS and their self-efficacy for healthy behaviors.

PA-00T-WSN,"In 2014, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funded the KNCV Tuberculosis Foundation, Management Sciences for Health and the World Health Organization to implement the five-year Challenge TB (CTB) Activity to support Ethiopias National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) in reducing TB incidence and related deaths by providing capacity building and technical assistance to the government, agencies, and health facilities to strengthen program management and service delivery. USAID/Ethiopia contracted Social Impact, Inc. to conduct a performance evaluation to examine Activity effectiveness, intervention challenges, and provide recommendations to guide decisions on future TB activity design and implementation. The evaluation team used mixed methods including document review, secondary data analysis, key informant interviews, and observations to identify findings that addressed USAIDs evaluation questions. The evaluation found that the range and reach of CTB interventions and technical assistance were comprehensive, high quality, and responsive to NTP needs. However, design and implementation challenges impeded efficiency (implementation delays, lack of depth in use of data for decision making), and effectiveness (variability in adherence to standards for case finding, treatment, and community-based interventions). While CTB excelled in supporting the expansion of critical diagnostic services, management of drug-resistant TB, and research, there was evidence of inconsistent practice of active case finding. Further, while capacity building activities were especially robust at zone and woreda level, the expectation of continued support from CTB staff for financial support and overall activity management limits long-term sustainability. The report makes eleven recommendations directed to USAID and the NTP on priorities for future design and implementation.",Evaluated project title: Ethiopia Performance monitoring and evaluation service (EPMES) ~|~_©_~|~ COR: Awoke Tilahun,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-663-C-16-00010,,7/1/2019 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Educational innovations ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Hospitals ~|~_©_~|~ International standards ~|~_©_~|~ Observation ~|~_©_~|~ Tuberculosis,Ethiopia,AID-OAA-A-14-00029,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TWSN.pdf,2418 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008543 - USAID.

PA-00T-WQX,"<div>This mid-term performance evaluation of the USAID Nepal Seed and Fertilizer (NSAF) Activity employed a qualitative approach to assessing efforts to increase the availability, accessibility, and use of quality seeds and fertilizers. The evaluation team held 97 key informant interviews and 10 focus group discussions to answer three evaluation questions. Based on the evidence collected, the evaluation team concludes that NSAF has technologies with high potential to increase farmer productivity, including yellow maize hybrids, Polymer Coated Urea (PCU), Urea Deep Placement (UDP) briquettes, and split fertilizer application technologies. A system based on seed companies and agrovets is sufficiently in place to take NSAF seed technologies to scale. However, a growing government fertilizer subsidy program and the crowding out of private sector activity may impede the scaling up of fertilizer technologies.<br /><br /></div> <div>The team recommends that NSAF focuses on the development of yellow hybrid maize varieties, PCU, UDP, and split application fertilizer technologies1. NSAF needs to expedite formal release and registration processes and review its exit strategy for seed technologies. NSAF with USAID should review the revised fertilizer technology-scaling model to clarify how the theory of change impacts of increased investment and private sector opportunity and improved economic policy and performance will be achieved. Actions with the Government of Nepal (GON) to make the fertilizer subsidy more effective need to be emphasized. USAID also should lobby the government in support of NSAF in regard to licensing permissions that are required for PCU and UDP technologies and the space allowed for commercial actors to supply the right fertilizer at the right time and place in line with Agriculture Development Strategy (ADS 2014) commitments.<br /><br /></div> <div>The activity also needs to focus the remaining period of the contract on technology dissemination with special consideration paid to the hard to reach groups, including women, disadvantaged groups, and minorities.</div>",Evaluated task order title: Nepal seed and fertilizer project (NSAF) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Monitoring evaluation and learning (MEL) ~|~_©_~|~ AOR/COR: Murari Adhikari,Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-367-C-15-00001,,7/1/2019 0:00,,Agricultural economics ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural production ~|~_©_~|~ Fertilizers ~|~_©_~|~ Maize ~|~_©_~|~ Private sector ~|~_©_~|~ Rice ~|~_©_~|~ Seeds ~|~_©_~|~ Tomatoes,Nepal,AID-367-IO-16-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TWQX.pdf,2021 KB,011830 - CAMRIS International,,008583 - USAID.

PA-00T-W5X,"This final whole-of-project evaluation of the Local Governance Project (LGP) examines the soundness of the LGP theory of change, collaboration among USAID implementing mechanisms, and possible adjustments to USAID/Ukraines approach to supporting local governance in Ukraine. LGP was launched in 2015 with three activities: Policy for Ukraine Local Self-Governance (PULSE), Decentralization Offering Better Results and Efficiency (DOBRE), and Municipal Finance Strengthening Initiative-II (MFSI-II). Using a mixed-methods approach, the evaluation team reviewed relevant documents, surveyed key informants and residents of assisted municipalities, and interviewed 156 key informants during three weeks of fieldwork in 21 municipalities across seven oblasts. The evaluation concluded that the development hypothesis is largely valid and could be further refined. LGP helped to strengthen local governance in Ukraine through its three activities and made significant progress toward realizing expected results. USAID/Ukraine provided support for creating a legal basis for consolidation; providing technical advice for central, regional, and local authorities; and introducing practical models and tools at the municipal level. However, there was not close cooperation between the two main activities, PULSE and DOBRE, in helping local governments manage resources and services effectively. Additional support in development and adoption of the local governance strategy is needed, and the evaluation identifies five areas for future assistance. This report concludes with 17 recommendations for future USAID support for local governance in Ukraine, including further support for decentralization legislation and municipal capacity development; better coordination between USAID implementers and with other donors; and expanding LGP support to more municipalities.","On title page: Submitted August 1, 2019 ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order title: Local governance project (LGP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Democracy, rights, and governance - learning, evaluation, and research (DRG-LER) ~|~_©_~|~ COR: Andrew Greer",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-M-13-00011 ~|~_©_~|~ GS-10F-0294V,,8/1/2019 0:00,,Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Decentralization ~|~_©_~|~ Economic growth ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Local level ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Transparency ~|~_©_~|~ Youth,Ukraine,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TW5X.pdf,2432 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,"040194 - USAID.

HHs in ZOI 2 had highest average sales value for vegetables whereas in ZOI 1 highest average sales value was for rice. Less than 5 percent of households that produced rice, maize, lentils, and goats had received support from the government, a project or the private sector in the previous 12 months about achieving increased yields or sales. Support was highest for vegetables (17%) and support received by HHs for vegetables in ZOI 1 (19%) was higher compared to ZOI 2 (15%). Only 12.7 percent of the households accessed formal agriculture finance. Lack of access to irrigation and limited knowledge of how to achieve higher yields and sales were found to be the major constraints in increasing yield and sales. Less than 10 percent of households accessed information on crop MPTs, market prices, and animal health and less than 20 percent of households accessed information on financial services, fertilizer, and seeds. The sampled households applied an average of 11.5 improved management practices and technologies (MPTs) from among 64 potential ones. There was no difference in use of average number of MPT across two ZOIs.<br /><br /></div> <div>Almost all the households (97100 percent) owned agricultural land, buildings (barns or storage) and hand tools (hoe, spade/shovel, rake, sickle, pickaxe, axe, pruning shears, etc.). Seventy four percent of households participated in at least one local group, with mothers groups, savings and credit groups, and cooperatives being the most common ones (2634 percent). Nearly two-thirds of households (63 percent) had been exposed to at least one shock or stressor (such as landslide, drought, illness, and flood) in the past 12 months. Severe impact on income (72 percent) and food consumption (51 percent) was reported by those exposed. The most commonly reported coping strategies (eight of the top ten) were either neutral or positive. Only 24 percent of households had used a negative coping strategy with the most common being selling livestock. Social capital was lower than expected, based on the relatively small percentage of households receiving or providing support during shocks or stressors. Such support was mostly from relatives living inside and outside of their community.<br /><br />Conclusively, the survey delivered the baseline values of 20 KISAN II performance indicators including the findings that portray the current resilience capacities of the selected households.</div>","Task order title: Knowledge-based integrated sustainable agriculture in Nepal II (KISAN II) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Monitoring evaluation and learning (MEL) ~|~_©_~|~ AOR/COR: Adhikari, Murari",Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-367-C-15-00001,,1/1/2019 0:00,,Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural markets ~|~_©_~|~ Goats ~|~_©_~|~ Households ~|~_©_~|~ Maize ~|~_©_~|~ Rice ~|~_©_~|~ Surveys ~|~_©_~|~ Vegetables,Nepal,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TVTG.pdf,2534 KB,011830 - CAMRIS International,,008583 - USAID.

PA-00T-VTC,"<div>This report presents findings and recommendations from the whole-of-Intermediate Result (IR) evaluation of activities generated from the USAID Civil Society and Media Project Appraisal Document (PAD) created in 2015. The evaluation included two current activitiesLiberia Accountability and Voice Initiative (LAVI) and Liberia Media Development (LMD)and incorporated information and interviews from the Civil Society and Media Leadership (CSML) activity, which predated the PAD. The evaluation determined how USAID activities made progress toward achieving the Project PurposeIncreased influence of citizens in the governance of public goods and servicesand provided recommendations to inform development of a future Civil Society and Media strategy.<br /><br /></div> <div>The evaluation found that the PAD contributed to increasing opportunities for civil society organizations (CSOs) and media outlets to play a watchdog role over governance. However, evidence is lacking that (1) CSOs can sustain the coalition approach beyond current USAID support, (2) CSOs can use the coalition approach to mobilize citizens more broadly to engage with government decision makers, and (3) media outlets can increase the quality of news and information disseminated to citizens.<br /><br /></div> <div>Critical gaps exist in making connections among the three stakeholder groups within governance accountability systems: (1) Political Leaders, (2) CSOs and Media Outlets, and (3) Citizens. A key priority for a future PAD would be to create interactive information and activity loops that better connect political leaders to citizens, using CSO coalitions and media outlets as channels through which citizens directly engage with government institutions.</div>",Evaluated project title: Liberia strategic analysis (LSA),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-669-C-16-00002,,6/1/2019 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Civic education ~|~_©_~|~ Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Elections ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Journalism ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Social sciences,Liberia,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TVTC.pdf,2230 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008570 - USAID.

PA-00T-TP5,"Implemented between September 2012 and January 2019, the USAID-funded Lebanon Industry Value Chain Development (LIVCD) project sought to develop inclusive and competitive value chains in rural areas of the country to help increase the income of the population there, including micro, small, and medium enterprises. The evaluation examines the projects relevance, efficiency and cost-effectiveness, effectiveness, sustainability, and additionality. It provides conclusions and recommendations to inform future activities and follow-on actions. The methods employed included a document review, 64 key-informant interviews, 28 focus group discussions (with 221 individuals), and direct observations.<br /><br /> <div>LIVCDs performance varied according to the targeted value chain. Interventions with avocado and olive farmers were the most cost-effective, while those with apple and cherry farmers were the least cost-effective. Significant contextual challenges hindered LIVCDs performance. However, the evaluation found evidence of improved incomes and competitiveness for avocado, olive, and grape farmers in addition to processed-food companies. There was limited or no income improvement for LIVCD-supported apple and cherry farmers. The total value of loans raised was considerable. However, access to finance improved for 102 beneficiaries only and was rather the result of investments leveraged by grants and technical assistance than that of activities aimed at promoting access to finance. Additionality was evident when new technologies or techniques were introduced. The project design included aspects related to ensuring sustainability. However, without further improvements in the quality of the produce, the interventions sustainability is at risk, especially in the apple value chain.</div>",Evaluated task order title: Lebanon industry value chain development (LIVCD) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Performance management and support program for Lebanon (PMSPL II),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-268-C-15-00001,,11/1/2018 0:00,,Apples ~|~_©_~|~ Avocados ~|~_©_~|~ Cherries ~|~_©_~|~ Grapes ~|~_©_~|~ Honey ~|~_©_~|~ Olives ~|~_©_~|~ Rural areas ~|~_©_~|~ Value chains,Lebanon,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TTP5.pdf,1311 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008568 - USAID.

PA-00T-T9R,"<div>Data for Development conducted a post-performance evaluation of the United States Agency for International Development Tanzanias (USAID/Tanzania) Capacity Development for Partners of Accountability (CPDA) Activity, or Pamoja Twajenga (PT) (Together we Build in Kiswahili) in late 2018. The activity, implemented by Chemonics from July 2013 to July 2017, supported the Missions grants to Tanzanian institutions of accountability (IoAs) and civil society organizations (CSOs), as well as other CSOs. PT provided capacity building support to improve constructive citizen-government engagement.<br /><br /></div> <div>The evaluation team (ET) used a mixed-methods approach through document and data review and key informant interviews to answer five evaluation questions. The ET found that PTs partners identified improved and constructive citizen/government engagement that had occurred over the course of the program. The ET found that the technical support provided to USAIDs CSO partners met the needs and priorities of the Mission in its management of CSO grant activities. Performance management data demonstrated that PT met or almost met its targets for capacity strengthening of CSOs, while IoA targets were not met as two of the three IoA partners had limited years of engagement with the project. The ET found that capacity developed with the support of PT has been sustained as long as CSOs have the financial resources. Stakeholders are largely satisfied with the performance of the contractor in training and providing TA. The evaluation makes recommendations for the Mission for any future capacity development support to CSOs or Government of Tanzania partners.</div>","Evaluated project title: Capacity development for partners of accountability (CPDA) also known as pamoja twajenga (PT) ""together we build in Kiswahili""",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-621-TO-17-00005 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-15-00024,,3/1/2019 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Organizational capacity ~|~_©_~|~ Rule of law ~|~_©_~|~ USAID ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Tanzania,AID-621-C-13-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TT9R.pdf,1040 KB,008414 - ME&A,,008612 - USAID.

PA-00T-S9N,"USAIDs Lebanon Water Project (LWP) is a $65-million activity that was launched in October 2015 and will conclude in September 2020. LWPs purpose is to improve: i) Service delivery and resource management of Lebanons five public-water utilities; ii) Civic engagement in water management and citizens perception of water utilities role in providing a necessary and valuable service; and iii) Private-sector involvement in water management. This mid-term performance evaluation has found that LWPs objectives meet USAID/Lebanons Country Development Cooperation Strategys objectives and beneficiary needs. LWPs assumptions remain valid. Its construction activities, management plans and tools, and training courses are improving Lebanons public-water utilities. The degree of impact varies. Delays have occurred in construction. LWP has established a diverse and wide-ranging grants program covering communities, agriculture, and industryissuing more than 32 grants. Media coverage has been substantial, with national campaigns reaching over 1.17 million people. One Public-Private Partnership was signed with one of the Regional Water Establishments (RWEs) for fees collection. Tender documents have been prepared and suggested for selected RWEs for model water supply Public-Private Partnerships with RWEs, , but no partnerships have been signed to date. No external contextual factors were found that would affect LWPs performance. LWP is putting in place mechanisms to ensure the initiatives it implements are sustained as much as possible.

This report analyzes the findings from the second wave of the longitudinal panel survey undertaken as part of the broader evaluation (Longley, Kamiri, and Remington, 2017). The panel survey tried to reach the same set of randomly sampled direct and indirect beneficiary smallholder farmers (as trackable over time) to assess and track their application and adoption (or not) of improved seed and other technologies. Farmers themselves, through interactions with relatives and neighbors, were found to be the greatest influence in motivating farmers to apply and adopt SSTP-promoted improved varieties (as identified by the farmer), while motivation from agro-dealers and seed companies was less important, especially among the indirect beneficiaries. Beneficiaries chose not to adopt varieties for reasons relating to the varietal characteristics, or if they could not sell the output after harvest. Future efforts to encourage smallholder farmers to both try out and continue to use improved varieties should: encourage farmer-tofarmer learning; ensure that appropriate varieties are selected for promotion; support linkages to output markets; support seed companies to enhance their marketing and distribution channels (including their relationships with agro-input dealers and the use of free varietal tester packs); and encourage more inclusive extension approaches that include women and poorer and socially marginalized groups.",Evaluated task order title: Scaling seeds and technologies partnership (SSTP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Program evaluation for effectiveness and learning (PEEL) ~|~_©_~|~ COR/AOR: Lesley Perlman,Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-TO-16-00008 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-15-00024,,7/1/2019 0:00,,Cassava ~|~_©_~|~ Demonstration ~|~_©_~|~ Farms ~|~_©_~|~ Partnerships ~|~_©_~|~ Poor ~|~_©_~|~ Potatoes ~|~_©_~|~ Seeds ~|~_©_~|~ Surveys,Senegal ~|~_©_~|~ Malawi ~|~_©_~|~ Ethiopia ~|~_©_~|~ Tanzania ~|~_©_~|~ Mozambique ~|~_©_~|~ Ghana,AID-OAA-A-13-00040,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TS5T.pdf,1601 KB,008414 - ME&A,,013469 - USAID.

This midterm evaluation of the HFA project has three objectives: (1) provide information about gaps and opportunities for the project; (2) understand the projects effectiveness in meeting intended results; and (3) identify areas for improvement. Evaluation methods include document review, key informant interviews, secondary analysis of program data, focus group discussions, facility observations, and organizational capacity assessments. <br /><br />Key Findings<br />  There has been general adherence to HFAs technical approach of co-diagnosis, co-design, and co-implementation, although progress toward targets has been uneven. <br /> The malaria municipal supervision tool is a strength, although provincial and national supervision tools need considerable revision. <br /> HFA has a strong HIV index case program but an infrequent measurement of retention in HIV care. <br /> Current training and supervision systems do not assure voluntarism and informed choice in family planning counseling. <br /> Overall, organizational capacity gaps include (1) the implementing teams not maximizing collaboration, (2) an insufficient performance management system, (3) incomplete quality and quantity of local capacity building, (4) stagnant progress on local handover, and (5) low potential for technical and financial sustainability. <br /><br />Recommendations <br /> Align training and supervision into an integrated capacity building approach. <br /> Jointly monitor health worker competence and performance with Government of Angola supervisors. <br /> Work with government counterparts to develop an HFA sustainability plan. <br /> Consider opportunities for integrating the community health worker role across service areas. <br /> Intensify local capacity building. <br /> Strengthen HFAs human resources to support operations.",Evaluated task order title:  Health for all (HFA) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health program cycle improvement project (GH Pro),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,,6/1/2019 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Case management ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Family health care ~|~_©_~|~ Health workers ~|~_©_~|~ Malaria ~|~_©_~|~ Municipal level,Angola,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TS5Q.pdf,4016 KB,Global Health Program Cycle Improvement Project (GH Pro) ~|~_©_~|~ 040668 - Dexis Consulting Group,,010822 - USAID.

PA-00T-RS2,"The Community Health and Social Welfare Systems Strengthening Program (CHSSP) is a five-year USAID and Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR)-funded program implemented by John Snow Inc. and World Education, Inc. The program works with the Government of Tanzania (GoT) and other health and social system actors to achieve two objectives: 1) higher performing human resources for community health and social welfare services; and 2) more functional, better coordinated community structures and systems to better serve key and vulnerable populations. The purpose of the evaluation is to: 1) assess program performance and achievements; 2) analyze the effectiveness of program implementation; and 3) document good practices, gaps/limitations, and lessons. The evaluation concludes CHSSP demonstrated a flexible management approach and took effective measures to address the multiple changes to its program description to stay on track and meet key indicator targets each program year. In addition, CHSSP made important contributions to strengthening: 1) the health and social welfare enabling environment; 2) human resource capacity at the national, regional, council, ward, and village levels; and 3) community structures and systems for providing community health and social welfare services to priority and key populations. Several threats, however, exist to the ongoing functioning and institutionalization of the contributions made by CHSSP. While the program has taken a number of steps to address these threats, any followon program will need to consider how to consolidate gains achieved during CHSSP and move them toward institutionalization within the GoT and the relevant community-level structures and systems.","On title page: Submitted: May 7, 2019 ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Community health and social welfare systems strengthening program (CHSSP)",Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-621-TO-17-00005 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-15-00024,,5/1/2019 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Case management ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Violence ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Tanzania,AID-621-A-14-00004,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TRS2.pdf,3241 KB,008414 - ME&A,,008612 - USAID.

USAID/India contracted Social Impact, Inc. to conduct a performance evaluation to examine project effectiveness, identify the factors that promoted social innovation, and document best practices and lessons learned to inform the future of USAIDs involvement in the Millennium Alliance Program. USAID provided evaluation questions related to innovation, leveraging, development outcomes, sustainability, management, gender, knowledge management and communications and the design of the Program. The Evaluation Team used mixed methods including document review, secondary data analysis, semi-structured interviews and group interviews to identify findings that address the evaluation questions. This report outlines key findings that the Program has been effective at identifying and financing inclusive innovation in India that address the development needs of the bottom of the pyramid, however, there are several design and implementation challenges that impede efficiency (staffing limitations, monitoring and evaluation system weaknesses), effectiveness (development outcome, innovation, sustainability, and leveraging limitations), and equity (regional and gender). The report makes 35 recommendations (17 high priority) for Millennium Alliance partners to address in the short, medium and long-term. Overall, the evaluation concludes that there are many areas for improvement of Millennium Alliance, but that continued investment into the project, with FICCI as the managing partner, would likely be beneficial for developing the inclusive innovation space in India.</span>","On title page: Submitted May 31, 2019 ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Millennium alliance (MA)",Special Evaluation,Documents,72038618F00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-486-I-14-00001,,5/1/2019 0:00,,Ecosystems ~|~_©_~|~ Educational innovations ~|~_©_~|~ Entrepreneurs ~|~_©_~|~ Intellectual property ~|~_©_~|~ Knowledge ~|~_©_~|~ Sanitation education ~|~_©_~|~ USAID ~|~_©_~|~ Women,India,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TRR2.pdf,1771 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008557 - USAID.

PA-00T-QT4,"The mid-term performance evaluation of the Enhance Non-Governmental Actors and Grassroots Engagement (ENGAGE) activity utilized a document review, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and two web-based surveys of sub-grantees and beneficiaries to assess the relevance and effectiveness, as well as unintended effects, of ENGAGE activities. Evaluation questions included: 1) Has the projects approach to enhancing civic education been effective? Why or why not? 2) Has the project increased the ability of citizens to engage in civic actions? Why or why not? 3) To what extent has the project increased the involvement of citizens in oversight and monitoring of corrupt practices and anticorruption policy-making? 4) What unintended effects have resulted to date from the project approaches, tools, and activities? 5) How do areas of overlap between efforts under this project and those of other USAID/Ukraine-implemented projects present redundancies and/or synergies? <br /><br />The evaluation team found that ENGAGEs approach on formal civic education was for the most part effective, achieving tangible outputs and emerging outcomes; however, the actual impact of the interventions is still to be seen across all civic education elements. Citizens have become more aware of the role and importance of the civil society, but increasing their awareness of government reforms and civic rights and responsibilities will require further work. Attitudes have also changed in the area of civic engagement, but results are mixed as to whether ENGAGE has improved citizens willingness to actually participate in civic actions. When it comes to establishing networks and coalitions, ENGAGE encountered many challenges. Finally, the evaluation team found that ENGAGE is coordinating less with other IPs than USAID intended.","Tasking number 8389.005 ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order title: Enhance non-governmental actors and grassroots engagement (ENGAGE) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Democracy, human rights, governance - learning, evaluation, research (DRG-LER)",Special Evaluation,Documents,GS-10F-0033M ~|~_©_~|~ 7200AA18M00016,,2/1/2019 0:00,,Civic education ~|~_©_~|~ Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Educational innovations ~|~_©_~|~ Judicial reform ~|~_©_~|~ Leadership training ~|~_©_~|~ Life skills ~|~_©_~|~ Mathematics ~|~_©_~|~ Social sciences,Ukraine,AID-121-A-16-00011,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TQT4.pdf,2404 KB,040818 - NORC at the University of Chicago,,"040194 - USAID.

PA-00T-Q59,"<span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">Social Impact (SI) conducted this mixed-methods, mid-term evaluation of the Yetu Initiative for the United States Agency for International Developments Kenya and East Africa Mission (USAID/KEA), an effort jointly funded with and implemented by the Aga Khan Foundation (AKF) to build the capacity of Kenyan civil society organizations (CSOs) to catalyze local support for local development needs. The evaluation seeks to learn from the strengths and limitations of the Yetu approach to inform local philanthropy strategies and practices. Of Yetus approaches, both bootcamps and subgrants  and most of their components  had a generally positive impact on many participating CSOs. The influence of regional workshops, blended learning, Yetus listserv and research were more variable. Outreach campaign tactics were seen slightly favorably, though were less effective outside of Nairobi. From a philanthropy ecosystem standpoint, Yetu has successfully built upon the local context and culture, strengthened organizations that carry out philanthropy ecosystem functions, and is exploring how to integrate these efforts into a sustained system. By design, Yetu has focused less on improving the enabling environment for philanthropy. In fact, while Yetu has addressed some of the endogenous barriers CSOs face to giving, Yetu was not designed to address the exogenous barriers around policy, legislation, and the individual and community factors that inhibit giving, though some preliminary, non-systemic progress toward the latter has been made. Though Yetu is not currently well-aligned with the USAID sub-intermediate result (IR) it falls under, it has contributed to USAIDs Development Objectives (DOs) focused on devolution as well as health and human capacity. By pursuing activities and CSO partners in counties outside Nairobi, Yetu also contributes to places of interest to USAID. Moving forward, USAID should consider supporting the Yetu-facilitated Collaborative Space as a convening entity, and better incorporating local and community philanthropy within its overall programming (not just Yetu).</span>","Evaluated task order title: Yetu ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Democracy, human rights & governance - learning, evaluation and research (DRG-LER) ~|~_©_~|~ COR: Andrew Greer ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluation summary: PA-00T-Q61",Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-M-13-00011 ~|~_©_~|~ GS-10F-0294V,,5/1/2019 0:00,,Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Ecosystems ~|~_©_~|~ Foundations ~|~_©_~|~ Fundraising ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Philanthropies ~|~_©_~|~ Space,Kenya,AID-615-A-14-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TQ59.pdf,1921 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,"040194 - USAID.

PA-00T-PRV,"USAID/Bangladesh contracted Social Impact, Inc. to conduct a mid-term performance evaluation of the Strengthening Political Landscape (SPL) project being implemented by Democracy International. The Evaluation Team (ET) conducted its fieldwork for this evaluation during February-March 2019, collecting data through an exhaustive document review, 50 key informant interviews and group interviews, 18 focus groups, and mini-surveys with 44 individuals. A key area of inquiry for the ET was to evaluate SPLs progress toward its main objectives of advancing youth and womens political participation and leadership; promoting constructive, tolerant cross-party engagement; and increasing participation in and the legitimacy of Bangladeshs election process. 1) The ET found that youth and women seeking greater roles within their parties have significantly strengthened their skills and modestly improved their responsibilities but only marginally attained advancement to party leadership positions due to entrenched power structures. 2) Through its young leaders fellowships, womens empowerment activities, and campaign for peaceful elections, party beneficiaries felt SPL had built several viable platforms for learning tolerance, building bridges or at least sitting down with opposing party members. However, much of this cross-party infrastructure and trust is now seen as damaged as a result of Bangladeshs 2018 Parliamentary election. 3) Progress toward SPLs third objective was undermined by the ruling Awami Leagues heightened control of the 2018 election, which included the arrests of many opposition Bangladesh National Party candidates and officials, blocking of polling agents and observers from their assigned stations, and pre-election stuffing of ballot boxes.",Evaluated project title: Strengthening political landscape (SPL),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-486-I-14-00001,,4/1/2019 0:00,,Associations ~|~_©_~|~ Democracy ~|~_©_~|~ Elections ~|~_©_~|~ Leadership training ~|~_©_~|~ Political participation ~|~_©_~|~ Political parties ~|~_©_~|~ Women ~|~_©_~|~ Youth,Bangladesh,AID-388-A-17-00003,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TPRV.pdf,1843 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008511 - USAID.

The evaluation further confirmed the use, in important instances, of data generated through the project to inform policy decisions on citizen security-related issues in each of the three countries.<br /><br />Among key recommendations are the need for: the design and implementation of training programs in the fields of official crime statistics, survey sampling, crime measurement scales, crime analysis for crime investigation and evaluation of crime prevention policies; and the strengthening of analytical capacity for evidence-based policymaking within relevant institutions.</span>",Evaluated project title: Regional citizen security project (InfoSegura),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-I-15-00024 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-519-TO-16-00002,,1/1/2019 0:00,,Civic education ~|~_©_~|~ Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Crimes ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Security ~|~_©_~|~ Violence,Central America,AID-596-IO-14-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TPB8.pdf,884 KB,008414 - ME&A,,008540 - USAID.

PA-00T-P84,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/Ethiopia designed the Strengthening Ethiopias Urban Health (SEUH) Activity to support the Government of Ethiopias (GoE) Urban Health Extension Program (UHEP) by improving the quality of urban health services, strengthening referral linkages, building the institutional and technical capacity of regional health bureaus, and promoting intersectoral collaboration on urban health challenges. Using a mixed-methods approach, this final performance evaluation examines SEUH design, implementation, effectiveness, and sustainability. The evaluation findings and recommendations can guide the U.S. government in its allocation of resources to support UHEP. <br /><br />Findings show that the design of SEUH was aligned with UHEP prioritieshygiene and environmental health; family health; disease prevention and control; and injury prevention and control, first aid, and referral servicesand responded to most UHEP needs. However, SEUHs design lacked a strategy for the health needs of the homeless urban poor and of youth and adolescents and did not sufficiently address interventions for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). SEUHs main contributions to supporting UHEP included human resource capacity building, quality improvement, demand creation, and regional platforms strengthening and establishing WASH platforms. SEUH contributed extensively to improving the health system for the housed urban poor and increasing the demand and delivery of health services. Except for the integrated refresher training of health workers which has been shifted to the government, the evaluation concluded that at the time of the evaluation, most of the SEUH strategies were not sustainable by the government without donor funding.",Evaluated project  title: Strengthening Ethiopias urban health (SEUH),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-663-C-16-00010,,2/1/2019 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Family health care ~|~_©_~|~ Hygiene ~|~_©_~|~ Poor ~|~_©_~|~ Sanitation education ~|~_©_~|~ Water sanitation,Ethiopia,AID-663-A-13-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TP84.pdf,2799 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008543 - USAID.

PA-00T-NS2,"This evaluation assesses the transferability and sustainability of the Healthy Communities and Municipalities II model and the viability of applying this model in non-health sectors. Evaluation questions explore the model in design and practice; what behavioral changes are observed; the degree to which governments and actors adopted the model; the feasibility of other sectors adopting the model; and, how the model can contribute to achieving USAID Development Objectives. The evaluation uses a qualitative analysis that applies transfer and sustainability criteria to key informant interview data. Interviewees include representatives from communities, governments, health facilities, decentralized sectors, NGOs, and firms. The results indicate the MCS model is versatile and can be applied in full or in part, according to context. Empowered community management councils work with local government and health officials to achieve health and other objectives. Five actors led the model in different contexts: multiple levels of government, a national institution, local governments, NGOs and private firms. The model is apt for adoption by different sectors and by USAID. The education, agricultural and housing sectors are particularly well suited to adopt the model. USAID already employs the model to strengthen community governance under alternative development activities, and the model can similarly serve as a vehicle for public service management and community forest management under DO2 and DO3. Future results and sustainability can be strengthened through the increased participation of regional governments, strengthening government and community council capacities, and replicating the projects success in identifying priority community demands as model entry points.",Evaluated project title: Healthy communities and municipalities II,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-527-C-13-00002,,2/1/2016 0:00,,Civic education ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Local level ~|~_©_~|~ Mortgages ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Sanitation education ~|~_©_~|~ Strategic objectives ~|~_©_~|~ Water sanitation,Peru,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TNS2.pdf,2723 KB,"041973 - Microsol Peru SAC ~|~_©_~|~ 040772 - Partners for Global Research and Development, LLC (PGRD)",,008591 - USAID.

PA-00T-NQ8,"This Final Evaluation constitutes an independent performance review of USAID/OTI Burmas Kann Let 2 (KL2) program from March 24, 2016, to March 23, 2019. The findings highlight the strategic approach, relevance, and impact of KL2 efforts to deepen and sustain the ongoing reform process in Burma and provide a concise explanation of achievements and lessons learned. The report is intended to inform future United States Government (USG) assistance, primarily the two new USAID/Burma Mission programs. Using a highly effective management strategy that involved empowerment of program development officers and grant managers, Development Alternatives Incorporated (DAI) implemented 233 Kann Let 2 activities, having spent $15.9 million, as of September 2018. From its desk review and extensive field work (including 98 interviews), the Final Evaluation Team found that the KL2 program identified the critical impediments standing in the way of reform in Burma, supported the work of groups aiming to build intercommunal harmony, expanded inclusion in the formal and informal peace processes, helped to foster and defend the space of civil society, and contributed substantially to US foreign policy. The evaluation recommends that future USAID assistance in Burma continue to support as much flexible, well-informed, locally-contextualized programming as possible, while retaining and utilizing KL2s significant analytical skills to address the barriers to advancing reform and peace.",Evaluated project title: Kann let 2,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-TO-15-00012 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-13-00006,,3/1/2019 0:00,,Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Judicial reform ~|~_©_~|~ Military ~|~_©_~|~ Missions (religious) ~|~_©_~|~ Political participation ~|~_©_~|~ Violence ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Burma,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TNQ8.pdf,1569 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,"010972 - USAID.

PA-00T-N2N,"World Hope International provides low-cost greenhouses to farmers in Sierra Leone and Mozambique  an agricultural innovation that has received monetary awards and support from Securing Water for Food. This report encompasses the monitoring and evaluation of the greenhouses installed in Mozambiques Gaza and Maputo provinces. In June 2018, field visits and interviews were conducted with 47 users to assess the innovation and its associated benefits. Since 2015, 44 greenhouses have been built and 33 still were operational by the time of this study. Farmers benefit from directly growing crops at the greenhouses, buying seedlings from the greenhouses owners, and learning new farming technique. With the greenhouses, farmers can grow crops faster and all year round, using less water and fewer seeds. Crops and seedlings grown in the greenhouses are of better quality and have greater chances for survival, because the greenhouses protect the plants from weather variations and pests. Farmers had an overall positive attitude towards the greenhouses and 87 percent of those interviewed plan to continue using them.",Evaluated project title:  Securing water for food (SWFF),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-C-15-00011,,11/1/2018 0:00,,Crops ~|~_©_~|~ Food ~|~_©_~|~ Greenhouses ~|~_©_~|~ Income ~|~_©_~|~ Seedlings ~|~_©_~|~ Seeds ~|~_©_~|~ Tomatoes ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Sierra Leone ~|~_©_~|~ Mozambique,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TN2N.pdf,4306 KB,"012951 - Kaizen Co., LLC",,040693 - U.S. Global Development Lab (GDL),English,application/pdf,,,"Capuano, Luciana",Crop production,Nov-18,,,,Securing water for food : World Hope impact evaluation : low-cost greenhouse farming in Mozambique,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=NTE5MDU0,,,,2018-11-01,2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PA-00T-N2M,"The Bhungroo water harvesting system is an agricultural innovation that has received a monetary award and support from Securing Water for Food. The Bhungroo system helps smallholder farmers harvest rainwater throughout the monsoon season so they can use it during the dry season. The Bhungroo system was developed by Naireeta Services in the state of Gujarat, India, to tackle the issues of salinization, desertification, and water scarcity in the region. This report details monitoring and evaluation of the recent installation of 52 Bhungroo systems among the poorest smallholder farmers of Harij in Gujarats Patan district. From 62 interviews with Bhungroo owners in a stratified all-female sample, evaluators established a baseline using statistics on household incomes, crop yields, water practices, expenses, and perceptions and expectations of the Bhungroo system. Though findings are preliminary, the women studied in this report appear to have fewer resources and to be more heavily impacted by regional water stress than a small nearby sample of women with established Bhungroos. Aside from yield and income changes experienced as a result of using the Bhungroo system, the report suggests other important themes for further monitoring, including issues related to water sharing, irrigation practices and tools, and the climate and precipitation of the region. Water stress in the area appeared to be at an all-time high at the time of this study, while land degradation was unmistakably prominent. The systems owners expressed hope for the Bhungroo system, which presents a viable possibility for positive impact directly on their households and more broadly on soil restoration, food security, and female empowerment for the entire region.",Evaluated project title: Securing water for food (SWFF),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-C-15-00011,,9/1/2018 0:00,,Crop yield ~|~_©_~|~ Crops ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Grasses ~|~_©_~|~ Income ~|~_©_~|~ Maps ~|~_©_~|~ Wheat ~|~_©_~|~ Women,India,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TN2M.pdf,2466 KB,"012951 - Kaizen Co., LLC",,040693 - U.S. Global Development Lab (GDL),English,application/pdf,,,"Orentlicher, Natalie",Irrigated farming and water management,Sep-18,,,,Securing water for food : Naireeta Services evaluation : bhungroo water harvesting system in India,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=NTE5MDUz,India,,,2018-09-01,2018,IND,IND_2018,0.5789687754530711,0.773860226889698,0.605015673981191,0.22077587477166696,0.329381263119288,,0.6308211132583079,0.426546930410326,0.5855386146520319,0.24920254484979198,0.448354143019296,0.586716398326081,,0.447098581388035,0.55293813098628,,0.5912408759124089,IND,2018,1.0,0.49649903307813403,2.0,0.5059331185685837,AZE_2015,AZE_2014,VNM_2013,HND_2018,AZE_2013
PA-00T-N2K,"FutureWaters ThirdEye was a SWFF-supported infrared flying sensors project that created a group of flying sensors operators equipped with tools to analyze near infrared imagery in order to help farmers to make better decisions concerning the use of their limited resources, such as water, seeds and fertilizers. This report analyses the results obtained by the monitoring and evaluation field intern who conducted an evaluation survey in July and August 2018 in Mozambique, after the project had been active there for 3 years. A sample of 62 predominantly female smallholder farmers were interviewed out of an estimated total of 2,891 farmers located in the areas where the project was carried out: surroundings of the towns of Xai-Xai and Chokwé, in Gaza province. Farmers were randomly selected through visits to their farms and data was obtained on household income, crop yields, water practices and expenses. Even though it was not possible to quantify changes in water usage, the innovation is seen as having a positive indirect impact over water efficiency in some areas by serving as encouragement for farmers to clean water channels or by providing the necessary justification to have fields leveled. Even though 59% of farmers increased their yields over the period examined, other factors besides the innovation were identified by farmers as also having an impact over production, explaining why farmers attitudes towards the innovation varied: 77% of farmers felt that the innovation was beneficial, even if indirectly, but 34%of the farmers felt either unsure or not interested in having the service continue.",Evaluated project title: Securing water for food (SWFF),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-C-15-00011,,11/1/2018 0:00,,Channels ~|~_©_~|~ Crops ~|~_©_~|~ Farms ~|~_©_~|~ Fertilizers ~|~_©_~|~ Gender dimensions of poverty ~|~_©_~|~ Income ~|~_©_~|~ Information ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Mozambique,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TN2K.pdf,8599 KB,"012951 - Kaizen Co., LLC",,040693 - U.S. Global Development Lab (GDL),English,application/pdf,,,"Feghali, Alice Kasznar",Agricultural management,Nov-18,,,,Securing water for food:  FutureWater evaluation thirdeye project in Mozambique,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=NTE5MDUy,Mozambique,,,2018-11-01,2018,MOZ,MOZ_2018,0.22157326015726397,0.42720551545585705,0.7575757575757579,0.629139321309281,0.19850026072592103,,0.29214504944867603,0.10243002806378501,0.340604608723896,0.13448933548916,0.306469920544835,0.217575258712537,,0.616891102805015,0.6492363448097329,,0.693430656934307,MOZ,2018,1.0,0.4529041270779928,2.0,0.3587302072860085,GIN_2018,NGA_2017,GIN_2013,GIN_2014,UGA_2016

The ET visited 21 media outlets in Kazakhstan and nine outlets in Tajikistan that benefitted from A2Is support. The ET found that the project has largely met its four objectives, with few gaps in the project; its design and structure are largely appropriate; implementation performance by USAID and Internews was strong; and that implementation of A2I as a regional program had advantages, but also some disadvantages. The ET also found that some indicators used by the project are not useful for understanding progress. The ET recommends that the project continue to support journalists and other media actors to report objective information; work with partner outlets on ways to better share different types of content across different platforms as well as on ways to monetize this sharing for competitiveness; increase its support to media outlets so they meet the challenge of the digital transition; and revise its indicators to more completely tell the story of A2Is contributions.</span></div>",Evaluated project title: Access to information (A2I),Special Evaluation,Documents,720011518D00003 ~|~_©_~|~ 72011518F00003,,2/1/2019 0:00,,Access to information ~|~_©_~|~ Advertising ~|~_©_~|~ Gender rights ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Journalism ~|~_©_~|~ Managers ~|~_©_~|~ Professional development ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Tajikistan ~|~_©_~|~ Kazakhstan ~|~_©_~|~ Central Asia,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TM6X.pdf,662 KB,008414 - ME&A,,008870 - USAID.

PA-00T-M6T,"<span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">The Tajikistan Agriculture and Water Activity (TAWA), funded by the United States Agency for International Development Central Asia (USAID/CA), is a four-and-a-half-year program (including the option period) designed to improve the nutritional outcomes of women of reproductive age and children under the age of two by increasing the yields and economic returns of household plots in Khatlon region. TAWA addresses four key project objectives through activities focused on agriculture extension services, vegetable production, orchard production, dairy production, and irrigation water management to increase, diversify, and add value to the agricultural production of smallholder farmers. This mid-term performance evaluation was commissioned to address key questions to help USAID better understand its investment in nutrition-sensitive agriculture in Tajikistan and strengthen the TAWA activity. The Evaluation Team (ET) conducted a desk review, interviews with key stakeholders in Dushanbe and Khatlon, focus group discussions with direct beneficiaries in Khatlon, and a telephone survey of 120 Womens Groups (WGs) members. The ET found that: adoption of new farming practices and technologies is high; some WGs may become sustainable after the project ends; WGs members appreciate the training they received but are looking for content that goes beyond basic skills; and training may have produced positive nutrition and income effects. The ET recommends formalizing roles and responsibilities within WGs, increasing coordination with state institutions, and providing more quality training.</span>",Evaluated project title: Tajikistan agriculture and water activity (TAWA),Special Evaluation,Documents,72011518D00003 ~|~_©_~|~ 72011518F00003,,2/1/2019 0:00,,Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural markets ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural production ~|~_©_~|~ Demonstration ~|~_©_~|~ Extension services ~|~_©_~|~ Income ~|~_©_~|~ Vegetables ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Central Asia ~|~_©_~|~ Tajikistan,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TM6T.pdf,942 KB,008414 - ME&A,,008870 - USAID.

PA-00T-KM1,"This report presents findings, conclusions, and lessons learned from an impact evaluation of the Womens Leadership in Small and Medium Enterprises (WLSME) activity in India. The evaluation used a quasi-experimental design, comparing four randomly assigned treatment groups to a matched comparison group across four outcome measures: business growth, entrepreneurial leadership, networks, and business knowledge and practices. The activity targeted 210 cashew-processing microenterprises and SMEs owned and managed by women in the Panruti block of Tamil Nadu State. After a baseline survey was conducted on eligible applicants, the sample was randomly assigned to four treatment groups. To avoid contamination, the comparison group was not randomized from the same sample as the treatment arms. Instead, it was randomly selected from a list of similar SMEs located in a geographically removed part of the Panruti block. The endline survey took place in May and June 2017, six months after the WLSME activity ended. The short-term findings are encouraging, primarily the entrepreneur leadership outcomes. Whereas most outcomes related to business growth, networks, and business knowledge and practices do not show a statistically significant link to the WLSME activity, the data show significant effects of sizable magnitude with respect to entrepreneur leadership.","On title page: October 26, 2017 (Revised March 6, 2019) ~|~_©_~|~ Footer title: Impact evaluation report : WLSME activity in India ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order title: Womens leadership in small and medium enterprises (WLSME) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: E3 analytics and evaluation",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-M-13-00017 ~|~_©_~|~ GS-23F-8012H,,3/1/2019 0:00,,Business growth ~|~_©_~|~ Cashews ~|~_©_~|~ Constraints ~|~_©_~|~ Entrepreneurs ~|~_©_~|~ Size ~|~_©_~|~ Small ~|~_©_~|~ Surveys ~|~_©_~|~ Women,India,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TKM1.pdf,800 KB,"003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

Implementing partner Tetra Tech provides USAID with engineering support, quality control, and other technical services for off-budget and on-budget projects in diverse sectors, including Energy, Vertical Structures, Transportation, Water, Irrigation, Sanitation, as well as support to Capacity-Building activities, including a female internship program. The evaluation team spent 35 days in-country reviewing documentation and conducting interviews, including 90 key informant interviews, 11 focus group discussions with 53 participants, and a survey of 53 Engineers and Technicians. Findings are that the Engineering Support Program has competent, skilled, and experienced staff - both expatriate and Afghan, however, the program has not performed to-date at the level expected. The evaluation team raised concerns over the contractors lack of responsiveness to the needs and protocols of USAID, Government of Afghanistan entities, and private sector contractors, as well as its inflexibility in adapting to the constraints of Afghanistan. The Engineering Support Program has also not capacitated Afghan counterparts as expected. The USAID Contracting Office and the Office of Infrastructure also bear some responsibility for slow response rates and imposing overly rigorous communication protocols.<br /><br /></span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">Recommendations include:<br /><br /></span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;""> Involving Engineering Support Program engineers and their Government of Afghanistan counterparts in the drafting of Job Orders;</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;""> Defining substantive deliverables in Job Orders;</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;""> Enforcing Tetra Techs contractual obligation to build capacity;</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;""> Turning the female internship program over to a local university;</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;""> Liberalizing communications between the Engineering Support Program and Government of Afghanistan stakeholders; and,</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;""> Increasing the responsibility and leadership roles of Afghans.</span></div>",Evaluated task order title: Engineering support program (ESP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Services under program and project office for results tracking phase II (SUPPORT II),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-306-C-12-00012,,8/1/2018 0:00,,Architecture ~|~_©_~|~ Canals ~|~_©_~|~ Engineers ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Managers ~|~_©_~|~ Water sanitation ~|~_©_~|~ Wells ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Afghanistan,AID-306-C-16-00010,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TKKC.pdf,1192 KB,"000356 - Checchi and Co.

However, most hard-to-reach villages lack a VMW/PP, though they receive services through other approaches, such as mobile teams.

PA-00T-K15,"<span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">For the mid-term performance evaluation of the United States Agency for International Development Afghanistans Regional Agriculture Development Program (RADP) the Evaluation Team (ET) independently assessed the programs influence on reducing land under poppy cultivation. The RADP aims to improve food and economic security of rural Afghans through four projects: RADP-North, RADP-West, RADP-South, and RADP-East. The ET used remote sensing to differentiate between illicit and licit agriculture and quantified the change in area under licit agriculture between pre-program implementation and the evaluation period. The ET used geographic information systems (GIS) data to identify programmatic districts and moderate resolution imagery (MRI) from the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager and the Thermal Infrared Sensor satellite for comprehensive coverage. To differentiate land cover types, the ET used the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and seasonal crop management differences. Results indicate that over the evaluated period, the area under poppy cultivation in RADP-South increased by 20 percent. As a percentage of total agriculture, the area decreased from 7.7 percent in 2013 to 7.4 percent in 2017. In RADP-North, the ET calculated a 440 percent increase in poppy production between the two periodsan increase of 2.1 percent in 2013 to 13 percent in 2017. Water availability contributed to increased poppy cultivation, although RADP-North showed evidence of poppy expanding to desert areas. In both RADP-East and RADP-West the area under poppy cultivation decreased by 78 percent and 57 percent, respectively. In both regions, the decline was attributed to environmental conditions more favorable to licit agriculture.</span>",Evaluated task order title: Regional agricultural development program (RADP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Program evaluation for effectiveness and learning (PEEL) ~|~_©_~|~ AOR/COR: Lesley Perlman,Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-I-15-00024 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-TO-16-00008,,2/1/2019 0:00,,Agricultural production ~|~_©_~|~ Classification ~|~_©_~|~ Crops ~|~_©_~|~ Harvesting ~|~_©_~|~ Livestock ~|~_©_~|~ Poppies ~|~_©_~|~ Size ~|~_©_~|~ Wheat,Afghanistan,AID-306-C-13-00018 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-306-C-14-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-306-C-14-00007,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TK15.pdf,2119 KB,"006381 - Abt Associates, Inc. ~|~_©_~|~ 008414 - ME&A",,013469 - USAID.

USAID funds the umbrella RADP, which has a budget of just over $241.7 million. The program is run as four separate regional projectsRADP-North, RADP-West, RADP-South, and RADP-Eastacross 21 provinces and 116 districts in Afghanistan. RADP aims to improve the food and economic security of rural Afghans. This evaluation was undertaken during implementation of RADP-North and RADP-East, and at the end of RADP-West and RADP-South. Using a cross-sectional design, the Evaluation Team (ET) used qualitative methods to answer all but one evaluation question, where geographic information system (GIS) and remote sensing methods were used by the ET. The results demonstrate mixed performance among the RADPs for key indicators. In addition, the projects did not always reach the intended scale. However, the ET found that project beneficiaries often experienced benefits from engaging with the projects. Many businesses reported improved operations with RADP support, and many farmers reported improved yields and incomes because of program participation. However, beneficiaries still faced significant challenges that were not addressed by the projects, including limited access to finance, a weak enabling environment, and particularly for farmers, water shortages and limited access to markets. The ET recommends that RADP strengthen linkages between farmers and the private sector, focus support on low input technologies, and increase collaboration with the government.</span>",Evaluated task order title: Regional agricultural development program (RADP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Program evaluation for effectiveness and learning (PEEL) ~|~_©_~|~ AOR/COR: Lesley Perlman,Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-I-15-00024 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-TO-16-00008,,2/1/2019 0:00,,Agribusiness ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural markets ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural production ~|~_©_~|~ Dairy cattle ~|~_©_~|~ Livestock ~|~_©_~|~ Value chains ~|~_©_~|~ Wheat ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Afghanistan,AID-306-C-13-00018 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-306-C-14-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-306-C-14-00007,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TK14.pdf,1176 KB,"006381 - Abt Associates, Inc. ~|~_©_~|~ 008414 - ME&A",,013469 - USAID.

Together, these entities can support the technical expertise and knowledge transfer, while building and strengthening collaborative intra-regional relationships. The RTC midterm performance evaluation examined 1) efficiency of project resource use, 2) whether collaborative relationships exist and are sustainable, and 3) how recipient countries use their new knowledge.<br /><br /></span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">The evaluation concludes that the trilateral exchanges facilitated by RTC have produced several important benefits including knowledge gained and applied, and cooperative relationships strengthened or formed with counterparts in the recipient and provider countries. These relationships have mostly endured and providers and recipients expect them to continue to endureat least as contingent assets, if not as ongoing, active relationships.<br /><br /></span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">As a mechanism for facilitating, incentivizing, and demonstrating the value of trilateral exchanges, RTC has been highly effective. However, the effectiveness has been at a high a cost relative to other possible approaches for facilitating trilateral cooperation. Its perceived cost-effectiveness and value-added are constrained by its primary role as a logistical support project, although it may take on more roles to increase its value-added. Whether USAID/El Salvador should continue RTC into its option year depends on whether it can expand RTCs current role and add more value.</span></div>",Evaluated project title: Regional trilateral cooperation (RTC),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-I-1500024 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-519-TO-16-00002,,12/1/2018 0:00,,Cooperation ~|~_©_~|~ Educational innovations ~|~_©_~|~ Fiscal policy ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Participants ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Rule of law ~|~_©_~|~ USAID,El Salvador,AID-596-TO-16-00006 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-13-00051,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TJWX.pdf,1702 KB,008414 - ME&A,,008540 - USAID.

This evaluation answers three evaluation questions (EQs), regarding VSFPs influence on parents school enrollment decision (EQ1), the probable impacts of pilot discontinuity on enrollment (EQ2), and canteen sustainability after VSFP ends (EQ3). The evaluation team (ET) conducted a desk review, 17 key informant interviews, and 25 focus group discussions. Alongside school data on student enrollment, attendance, and performance, the ET used these multiple data sources to analyze and draw findings, conclusions, and recommendations about VSFP.<br /><br /></span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">For EQ1, the evaluation concluded that school canteens are closely connected to parents decision to enroll their children. Other motivating factors include low tuition and education quality. However, for the most vulnerable, canteens factor significantly into families economic and livelihood decisions. For EQ2, the ET concluded that the canteen has a clear impact on attendance. Whether or not a child eats at school factors strongly into parents decisions about how frequently children go to school, and motivates students to arrive before school, and stay throughout the day. Overall, the ET found that school attendance frequency would decline if VSFP ends. For EQ3, stakeholders considered ways to continue the school feeding activities after VSFP. FPDI is actively seeking support for VSFPs continuation, however, area families face difficult economic situations, limiting most community stakeholders ability to materially contribute to ensure program continuity.</span></div>",Evaluated project title: Voucher school feeding pilot (VSFP,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-521-C-17-00002,,8/1/2018 0:00,,Child malnutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Children ~|~_©_~|~ Communes ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Enrollment ~|~_©_~|~ Poverty ~|~_©_~|~ School attendance ~|~_©_~|~ School feeding programs,Haiti,AID-521-A-15-00013,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TJR1.pdf,812 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008554 - USAID.

This information includes a set of sociodemographic, economic, and institutional data ordered systematically under the theory of change and following the programs development hypothesis. The study used mixed methods (surveys, in-depth interviews, and participatory workshops) to investigate the conditions of rural households and community organizations in the territory. The coverage area is 45 municipalities that share critical conditions (assumptions), a low government presence, the effects of the conflict on the population and territory, high degrees of marginalization, and precarious living conditions, along with the presence of illicit crops. Multivariate analyses were carried out using correlations, hierarchical cluster analysis, and principal component analysis to investigate the interaction between the variables of citizen security, social capital, and territorial governance. The main conclusions of the study reflect that the critical assumptions were confirmed along with the negative impact they have on the conditions of social capital and territorial governance.</span>",Project title:  community development and licit opportunities program (CDLO),Special Evaluation,Documents,72051418F00008 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-514-I-14-00001,,10/1/2018 0:00,,Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Income ~|~_©_~|~ Perception ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Rural areas ~|~_©_~|~ Trusts,Colombia,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TJNG.pdf,2065 KB,041952 - Olgoonik Technical Services LLC,,008530 - USAID.

The study measures Activity outcomes and changes over 12 months for a subset of Youth Potential beneficiaries from four Ethiopian regions. The study uses a panel design and qualitative and quantitative approaches to measure changes in income, employment status, work readiness skills, knowledge of and access to employment/entrepreneurial resources, and functional literacy and numeracy skills. Data were collected at three points of the study - baseline, midline and endline - through surveys, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and informational meetings. <br /><br />The study findings show that 12 months after participation in the Activity, a significantly larger number of participants were employed (69 percent) and had a higher income (71 percent) than at baseline. Of those employed, 88 percent were self-employed, with agriculture and trading as the primary occupations. Participants reported that they had greater self-confidence and a better work ethic and felt more empowered in searching for employment, creating self-employment, and obtaining complete information.",Evaluated project title:  Building the potential of youth also known as youth potential (YP),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-663-C-16-00010,,2/1/2019 0:00,,Agricultural occupations ~|~_©_~|~ Enrollment ~|~_©_~|~ Income ~|~_©_~|~ Mathematics ~|~_©_~|~ Socioeconomic status ~|~_©_~|~ Sports ~|~_©_~|~ Unemployment ~|~_©_~|~ Youth,Ethiopia,AID-663-C-16-00010,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TJMR.pdf,4529 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008543 - USAID.

PA-00T-JMD,"<p class=""p1"">This midterm evaluation of the Sustaining Health Outcomes Through the Private Sector (SHOPS) Plus project, a five-year USAID global health program (2015-2020), was undertaken to assess: (1) the projects family planning achievements; (2) how it applied newer areas of focus (Public-Private Engagement [PPE], Health Financing [HF], Total Market Approach [TMA], Corporate Engagement [CE]); and (3) the effectiveness of the implementing consortium. Methods included: key informant interviews, an electronic survey, visits to Nepal and Tanzania, and review of documents. Key informants included SHOPS Plus staff, partners, USAID personnel, and stakeholders.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;<br /><br /></span></p> <p class=""p1"">The evaluation concluded that activity implementation had progressed well at the global level and in all but two countries where significant delays had occurred due to external factors. Achievements in family planning were diverse: (a) social marketing, strengthening social marketing organizations, and resulting couple-years protection; (b) data generation, dissemination, use; (c) strengthening service delivery; (d) applications of newer focus areas; and (e) global engagement. Of the newer focus areas, PPE was applied the most; opportunities for HF were limited; TMA-related activities were implemented in three countries; CE was applied on a modest scale (in family planning, HIV, water treatment). The SHOPS Plus consortium appears well managed and effective in providing technical expertise. Recommendations include: consolidating and deepening current activities and learning; increasing cross-fertilization of technical expertise between consortium partners and across country offices; increasing contextual appropriateness of aspects of the gender work; and continuing to promote the private sector but with balance and <span class=""s1"">candor about its limitations and failures and means of addressing them.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></span></p>",Evaluated task order title: Global health program cycle improvement projet (GH Pro) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Sustaining health outcomes through the private sector project  plus(SHOPS Plus),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,,2/1/2019 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Dance ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Family health care ~|~_©_~|~ Private sector ~|~_©_~|~ Reproductive health ~|~_©_~|~ Social marketing ~|~_©_~|~ Youth,Africa south of Sahara ~|~_©_~|~ Tanzania ~|~_©_~|~ Afghanistan,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TJMD.pdf,3291 KB,040668 - Dexis Consulting Group,,011262 - USAID.

Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University implemented this project as the Management Entity and was joined by three sub-awardees. This final evaluation focused on questions related to institutional sustainability, capacity development, institutional and stakeholder use of InnovATE materials, and project response to AET practitioners and USAID Mission needs. The evaluation used document reviews and remote key informant interviews to collect data. The Evaluation Team (ET) found that InnovATE achieved planned objectives in developing and disseminating valuable educational and training materials and contributed to AETs knowledge base in several cross-cutting fields, including gender, vocational training, youth entrepreneurship, quality assurance, and accountability. Several other objectives were not achieved, however, partly due to lack of Mission responsiveness, and limited in-country outreach activities. The ET recommends that similar projects in the future develop viable plans to work with Missions to create awareness, get buy-in and support from the outset, and create closer linkages between other Feed the Future projects, Missions, and institutions in host-country.</span>",Evaluated task order title: Innovation for agricultural training and education (InnovATE) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Program evaluation for effectiveness and learning (PEEL),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-1-15-00024 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-TO-16-00008,,11/1/2018 0:00,,Feed supplements ~|~_©_~|~ Food ~|~_©_~|~ Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Institutional sustainability ~|~_©_~|~ Learning readiness ~|~_©_~|~ Life skills ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion ~|~_©_~|~ Rural areas,Honduras,AID-OAA-L-12-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TJ6D.pdf,1137 KB,008414 - ME&A,,013469 - USAID.

The evaluation assesses current levels of service delivered by supported water and sanitation installations; factors that may have supported or impaired the sustainability of selected results; and how activity beneficiaries are applying supported hygiene practices. The team conducted a desk review; interviewed activity beneficiaries, partners, and stakeholders; and made structured observations at WASH-UP installations.<br /><br /></span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">The evaluation finds that WASH-UP supported water schemes, including household and school water connections, community water points, and water kiosks, continue to provide services to beneficiaries. However, household and institutional beneficiaries raised concerns about the cost of piped water, which has led some service cancellations. Most WASH-UP supported household and institutional latrines continue to be operational, but large households and households with tenants are more likely to have non-functional latrines due to filled septic tanks and pits and the cost of desludging. The evaluation team recommends that USAID consider supporting alternative financial arrangements for compound and multi-family households and invest in broader support to address fecal sludge management in high-density urban centers.<br /><br /></span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">WASH-UP also supported Water and Sanitation Committees (WSC) to manage public water and sanitation facilities. In most cases, WSCs continue to function and provide core services to their communities, although in three of five WSCs support for community sensitization to safe hygiene practices has lapsed. In addition, there is mixed evidence on sustainment of supported hygiene practices. The evaluation team recommends that USAID consider medium- and longer-term support to institutional actors such as WSCs, including linking them to government stakeholders to foster sustainability.</span></div>","Footer title: Ex-post evaluation of the WASH-UP activity in Ghana ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order title: Water access, sanitation, and hygiene for urban poor (WASH-UP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Management support and technical assistance services (MSTAS) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: E3 analytics and evaluation",Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-M-13-00017 ~|~_©_~|~ GS-23F-8012H ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-M-13-00012 ~|~_©_~|~ GS-10F0104R,,11/1/2018 0:00,,Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Handwashing ~|~_©_~|~ Health care costs ~|~_©_~|~ Households ~|~_©_~|~ Hygiene ~|~_©_~|~ Rural areas ~|~_©_~|~ Sanitation education ~|~_©_~|~ Water sanitation,Ghana,AID-EPP-A-00-09-00014,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TJ6C.pdf,1946 KB,"003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

PA-00T-J6B,"This ex-post evaluation examines the sustainability of outcomes from USAIDs Sustainable, Comprehensive Responses for Vulnerable Children and their Families (SCORE) activity. SCORE developed family-specific plans to graduate households from activity support. The activity focused on capacity building, improving socioeconomic status, food security, and access to protection and legal services. The evaluation collected qualitative data from beneficiaries and key stakeholders across seven districts in Uganda.<br /><br /> The evaluation found that households learned new skills and knowledge to help them mitigate their challenges, including village savings and loan associations, home gardening, and farming. However, financial instability remains a common challenge among households, and their circumstances and levels of vulnerability vary widely. About 88 percent of households reported experiencing a shock or stressor in the last year, although nearly 40 percent felt they did not have the ability to handle shocks, and 26 percent felt they could handle shocks but with difficulty. Respondents felt that SCORE did not provide enough support for the most critically vulnerable households (e.g., elderly, disabled). <br /><br />The evaluation concluded that SCOREs strengthening of households skills reduced the impact of shocks and stressors for many households. However, there is a need to examine hindering factors, particularly those beyond the activitys control such as natural disasters that can have a huge economic impact on households that rely on farming. As one of the first graduation models of its kind, lessons learned from SCORE  both positive and negative  require further testing and time, and strong monitoring and evaluation practices to continue to learn from them.","Evaluated task order title: Sustainable, comprehensive responses for vulnerable children and their families (SCORE) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title:  E3 analytics and evaluation",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-M-13-00017 ~|~_©_~|~ GS-23F-8012H,,12/1/2018 0:00,,Children ~|~_©_~|~ Food production ~|~_©_~|~ Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Households ~|~_©_~|~ Knowledge ~|~_©_~|~ Learning readiness ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion ~|~_©_~|~ Socioeconomic status,Uganda,AID-617-A-11-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TJ6B.pdf,1365 KB,"011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

The main objective of ACCOUNT is to create an environment that increases civil society participation to promote reform through collaboration and cooperation in anti-corruption initiatives. This Activity involves evidence-based research, civic monitoring, and investigative reporting on corruption cases in five sectors: i) public procurement, ii) whistleblower protection, iii) education, iv) health, and v) public employment. The evaluation focuses on the direct beneficiaries of the program and answers five research questions. The first question examines to what extent ACCOUNT has increased Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) involvement and input in determining anti-corruption legislation/regulation. The second question examines ACCOUNTs major achievements in public procurement, whistleblower protection, education, health, public employment, and local-level anti-corruption strategies/action plans. The third question examines to what extent ACCOUNT has increased the quality and quantity of investigative journalism targeting public corruption in BiH. The fourth question examines to what extent interventions under ACCOUNT have influenced public awareness of corruption. Finally, the fifth question examines if ACCOUNTs legal-aid model is perceived as effective by program beneficiaries. The evaluation team employed a mixed-methods approach to answer each of the evaluation questions through triangulation. In addition to the review of ACCOUNTs design and implementation documentation, we held 39 semi-structured interviews and a media panel discussion, with a total of 65 individuals participating in the evaluation. We also conducted surveys of media and CSO representatives and education workers, as well as reviewing the quality of investigative reports produced by ACCOUNT media outlets. Our evaluation shows that overall ACCOUNT performance is perceived as a positive CSO endeavor in the field of anti-corruption in Bosnia and Herzegovina. ACCOUNT gathered a significant number of CSOs in the Network on anti-corruption issues. Through advocacy activities, ACCOUNT facilitated the putting forward of quality CSO inputs and their partial integration into legislation in the field of anti-corruption. Achievements are evident in all five sectors, especially in relation to whistleblower-protection legislation and draft public-procurement legislation. The demand-driven approach was effective and contributed to the visible results. Since Annual Reports did not document progress against goals and objectives but rather according to activities, some achievements were difficult to identify and measure. Media reporting on corruption has been intensive among ACCOUNT media outlets, and an increased level of readership is noted. However, the team was not able to confirm a change in the quantity of media reporting due to the lack of any baseline data on corruption investigative reports, either in the aggregate or per individual media outlet. The quality of ACCOUNT investigative reporting within the content evaluation is generally rated above good, with one in four articles being very good or excellent. It is important to note that media reporting focuses primarily on quantity with regard to advocacy and awareness raising. However, the majority of citizens (80%) remain tied to traditional media outlets over online portals/social media, and the outreach of ACCOUNT investigative reporting remained limited. Citizens perceptions on corruption remain unchanged since 2015, which indicates that the ACCOUNT assumption that citizens would consume their online media products remains largely unfulfilled, as only 20 percent of citizens use the online sources as a means of consuming civic and political news. Regarding ACCOUNTs work on the establishment of an effective free legal-aid model to protect individuals reporting corruption and whistleblowers, the model has been useful but insufficient to protect citizens in the absence of a strong institutional and judicial system. In the end, we identified recommendations for future programming to support civil society engagement in anti-corruption, involvement of the media, and provision of free legal aid.</span>",Footer title: Performance evaluation of account follow-on activity ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Anti-corruption civic organizations' unified network (ACCOUNT) ~|~_©_~|~ COR: Elma Bukvic Jusic,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-168-C-14-00003,,2/1/2019 0:00,,Anticorruption interventions ~|~_©_~|~ Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Internet ~|~_©_~|~ Journalism ~|~_©_~|~ Legal aid ~|~_©_~|~ Litigation ~|~_©_~|~ Networks ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration,Bosnia and Herzegovina,AID-168-A-15-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TJ44.pdf,3176 KB,"041024 - IMPAQ International, LLC",,009954 - USAID.

MCSP-MNCH baseline data was not available nor calculable for magnesium sulphate or Kangaroo Mother Care. Data was also not available for postpartum family planning for first-time parents and Bubble Continuous Positive Airway Pressure for newborn resuscitation, as a study was undergoing analysis and data was not ready. Furthermore, the dataset MCSP-MNCH provided to the evaluation team was incomplete, imprecise, and contained errors, raising concerns about noted improvements.<br /><br /></span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">The programs work in male engagement and Mothers Savings and Loans Clubs hold promise for transforming gender norms but reached too few people.

The learning agenda helped inform implementation, but the government did not help shape the research. Last, MCSP-MNCH project created a new DHIS database instance for its project data only, including new indicators that it introduced (like application of Chlorhexidine 4% gel for newborn cord care), as well as indicators that were already available in the national DHIS 2 database; it is housed within the same server as the national DHIS 2</span></div>","On title page: ""Evaluation Assignment Number: 586"" ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Maternal child survival program (MCSP) ~|~_©_~|~ Global health program cycle improvement project (GH Pro) conducted the evaluation",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,,1/1/2019 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Child health care ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Health care costs ~|~_©_~|~ Oxytocin ~|~_©_~|~ Postnatal nutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion ~|~_©_~|~ Violence against women,Nigeria,AID-OAA-A-14-00028,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00THVR.pdf,2692 KB,"011976 - QED Group, LLC ~|~_©_~|~ 040668 - Dexis Consulting Group",,010822 - USAID.

This Mid-Term Evaluation explores whether these programs activities are making progress toward planned results, and to what extent financial, management, and M&amp;E systems are affecting implementation and achievement of results. The evaluation relied on document and data review, Key Informant Interviews, Focus Group Discussions, observation of program teams, and a randomized, 30-cluster sample survey of health facilities (30) and individual women (320).<br /><br /></span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">Findings:</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">Though designed to work together, the two programs function separately. Both experienced delays due to difficulties setting up administrative processes; hiring and retaining qualified staff; and contracting with and strengthening local NGOs. KJK is on track to meet its program targets; however, Jigi, the local NGO contracted to sustain the activities, is not yet implementing SBCC activities. SSGI is on track to meet training targets and has improved performance at some facilities, but not yet consistently or sustainably. Both programs will require additional time to achieve planned results.<br /><br /></span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">Recommendations:</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">1.

KJK should second technical staff to Jigi and the CNIECS in the remaining project period to build their capacity to continue SBCC after KJK ends. This should be prioritized over research.</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">3. SSGI should second its staff to regional and district offices in the remaining project period and focus on sustaining quality health service delivery and addressing barriers to access.</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">4.

PA-00T-HNS,"<div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">A team of five The Mitchell Group (TMG) Inc. consultants conducted a midterm evaluation of the Sub-National Governance Project (SNGP), a five-year, $22 million USAID-funded project, awarded to Tetra Tech ARD (TT) and consortium of four sub-contractors. SNGP has an overall goal of advancing Malis decentralization process by creating and institutionalizing effective financial and asset management procedures. The evaluation utilized a mixed methods research approach, leveraging both qualitative and quantitative methods, around seven USAID-developed evaluation questions that formed the principal areas of inquiry and were in turn consolidated under three broader analytic frames: SNGP Theory of Change, SNGP Management Approach and SNGP Performance and Impact.<br /><br /></span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">The evaluations principal conclusion is that there were fundamental problems in many dimensions of the project, from its conception to its implementation and in the monitoring and evaluation of project activities. Some of these problems were due to TTs choices in the way it managed the project; some were due to the faulty design of the project; and, yet others were due to external factors in SNGPs operating environment. The evaluation teams recommendations include:<br /><br /></span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">1. SNGP should undertake a strategic moment of reflection retreat for its partners where identified problems can be discussed.</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">2. SNGP should transition to direct funding of partners showing that TT has confidence in their capacity to responsibly manage funds.</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">3.

Evaluation methods included a desk review of relevant documents, monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) data, key informant interviews (KIIs), focus group discussions (FGDs), and short interviews with stakeholders in Monrovia, Kakata, and Gbarnga. <br /><br />The evaluation found that inaccurate assumptions and planning led to flaws in the original design, which were influenced by the lack of co-design with GOL partners. The management structure and approach was risky and lacked consistent and reliable oversight. The redesign was appropriate in fixing the constraints by integrating components better, promoting cross-pollination, and shifting toward a multiagency approach to combating corruption. Since the redesign, LPAC experienced uneven progress working with the legal and regulatory institutions but achieved the greatest results and value with the LNBA and LACC.

MCSPs support for the existing cascade training model, quality improvement approaches, and setup of the Learning and Performance Improvement Center (L&amp;PIC) sites were in line with the MOHS policy. The effectiveness of MCSP was demonstrated by improved staff performance scores and high knowledge retention rates. MCSP supported the creation of professional development opportunities for midwives, lady health visitors, and other basic health staff via continuous education, accreditation, and a clinical skills-based assessment relicensing system. MCSP successfully engaged with ethnic health organizations (EHOs) and increased trust and coordination between the MOHS and EHOs.

PA-00T-H2K,"<span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">The Social Enterprise Boost Initiative (SEBI) is a six-year1 micro-enterprise development activity aimed at supporting and facilitating the growth of social enterprises (SEs) and their contribution to the social economy in Jamaica. SEBIs activities are implemented under four specific, yet inter-related technical objectives. SEBI achieves those objectives through four main initiatives focusing on strengthening the capacity of a select number of social enterprises/entrepreneurs to help them become viable businesses, creating an enabling environment for the SE sector by improving institutional capacity through information sharing, raising public awareness of the sector, and reviewing options for a permanent version of the program potentially through Social Enterprise Jamaica (SEJA2). This final performance evaluation was commissioned to determine whether the SEBI activity achieved its objectives. The evaluation team was tasked with answering three questions regarding whether program objectives were achieved, adopting a mixed-methods approach based on interviews with direct beneficiaries and key stakeholders and focus group discussions with indirect beneficiaries, both in Kingston and St. Andrew, as well as the rural parishes. Two surveys were also conductedone with SEBI incubator and accelerator clients and a nationwide public awareness survey on SEs. The evaluation found that SEBI was instrumental in increasing public awareness of SEs although this varied according to geographic location. SEBIs clients also benefited from capacity building measures and creation of a SE network.</span>",Evaluated project title: Social enterprise boost initiative (SEBI),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-I-15-00024 ~|~_©_~|~ 72053218F00002,,12/1/2018 0:00,,Business enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Earnings ~|~_©_~|~ Entrepreneurship ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Music ~|~_©_~|~ Television ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Jamaica,AID-532-A-12-00004,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TH2K.pdf,2278 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates,,008563 - USAID.

PA-00T-GR7,"This is a mid-term evaluation of the Tusome Pamoja (TP) Activity, which utilized key informant interviews (KIIs), focus group discussions (FGDs), and brief quantitative surveys (QSs) to investigate: 1) progress towards improving reading, writing, and arithmetic [also referred to by the Government of Tanzania (GOT) as the 3Rs]; 2) use of School Information System (SIS) to improve 3Rs; 3) internalization of capacity building and how to more effectively improve learning outcomes of the 3Rs; and 4) sustainability. The evaluation finds that quality reading materials have been designed and disseminated. The TP Activity and the GOT show commitment in working together to design and align materials. Capacity building activities have resulted in knowledge and attitude changes at the school and local government level, and some behavior change has occurred. Due to materials and training, gains appear to have been made in reading, teaching, and learning. Arithmetic has not yet been addressed because of funding limitations of the USAID Global Education Strategy at the time of this evaluation. Moving forward, SIS may support oversight of reading progress, but human and information and communications technology (ICT) challenges remain. Parents can also contribute to improving 3Rs and are motivated to help in schools; however, they require more training in order to understand how they can help their children master the 3Rs at home.",Evaluated project title: Let's read together (tusome pamoja),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-621-TO-17-00005 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-15-00024,,11/1/2018 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Arithmetic ~|~_©_~|~ Knowledge ~|~_©_~|~ Learning readiness ~|~_©_~|~ Life skills ~|~_©_~|~ Local level ~|~_©_~|~ Mathematics ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion,Tanzania,AID-621-C-16-00003,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TGR7.pdf,2273 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates,,008612 - USAID.

PA-00T-GD5,"The USAID Assistance in Building Afghanistan by Developing Enterprises (ABADE), a five-year, $105 million activity that ended on July 31, 2018, was designed to support enterprise development and job creation through assistance to Small and Medium Enterprises. This final performance evaluation provides verification of activity outputs and outcomes, and assesses whether ABADE was implemented effectively. The report will serve as a lessons-learned document to inform the design and implementation of future activities. The statement of work focused on four questions: 1. To what extent program support to Small and Medium Enterprises contributed to increased employment, production, and access to finance, and enhanced ability of Small and Medium Enterprises to meet market requirements? 2. To what extent program reported on indicators, and effect of such monitoring on decisionmaking and implementation? 3. To what extent program was effective in leveraging investment from the private sector? 4. How worthwhile was programs investment in machinery; how sustainable is it likely to be? Methodology included document review; key informant interviews; focus group discussions; and a quantitative survey across four provincial centers. Conclusions:  Intervention logic was sound, but design had shortcomings: technical support requirements were under-estimated, intermediate outcomes were not tracked.  Outreach was effective, but implementation was hampered by delays in approvals, vetting, and customs.  Beneficiary Small and Medium Enterprises created jobs, accessed domestic and export markets, and increased sales and investment.  Procurement of machinery on behalf of Small and Medium Enterprises was a temporary fix and not a solution to the problem of access to finance.",Evaluated task order title: Assistance in building Afghanistan by developing enterprises (ABADE) ~|~_©_~|~ Task order title: Services under program and project office for results tracking-phase II (SUPPORT-II),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-306-C-12-00012,,12/1/2018 0:00,,Agricultural production ~|~_©_~|~ Business enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Economic growth ~|~_©_~|~ Exports ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Food production ~|~_©_~|~ Investment ~|~_©_~|~ Private sector,Afghanistan,AID-EEM-A-00-04-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TGD5.pdf,2437 KB,"Checchi and Company Consulting, Inc.",,USAID Mission to Afghanistan,English,application/pdf,,,"Abid, Rahmatullah ~|~_©_~|~ Dunn, Denis ~|~_©_~|~ Iqbal, Humayoon ~|~_©_~|~ Mufti, Babar",Economic growth and development,Dec-18,,,,Evaluation : final performance evaluation of assistance in building Afghanistan by developing enterprises,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=NTE1NDAw,Afghanistan,,,2018-12-01,2018,AFG,AFG_2018,0.17249453738066597,0.5588158246062579,0.7586206896551719,,0.24387603621955103,,,0.208608047860783,0.21721929113144603,,0.256526674233825,0.218522268155457,,0.0,0.37432047631374604,,0.474452554744526,AFG,2018,2.0,0.299263302165644,4.0,0.3311899815788683,ETH_2014,ETH_2013,ETH_2018,ETH_2015,AGO_2018

PA-00T-FNH,"<span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">Development Object (DO) 1 of the USAID/Kyrgyz Republic 2015-2019 Country Development Cooperation Strategy aims to support inclusive and accountable democracy. Eight activities under this DO sought to improve inclusivity and accountability in parliament, political parties, election agencies, human rights institutions, the judiciary, civil society, and media. This support sought to achieve a level of capacity in key democratic institutions that enables them to sustainability fulfill their respective missions and deliver public goods. This midterm performance evaluation of DO 1, through a review of documents, polling data, interviews, and focus groups, found the accountability of parliament, political parties, elections agencies, civil society, and the media improved between 2015 and 2017. There was only marginal improvement in the judiciary and human rights. USAID programming helped make democracy deliver in elections, civil society, and the media. Citizens were generally satisfied with democratic development and democratic institutions, and they did not seek systemic change except for a greater effort to fight corruption. The number of women holding national or local elective office has declined since the start of the evaluation period, but the 2020 elections will provide a fairer test of the effect of activities that have strengthened both womens leadership and youth participation. Citizens, including ethnic minorities, have increased access to civic information on government and political issues thanks to USAID activities. Together USAID-supported activities contributed to achieving Intermediate Result 1.1, Increased participation of all citizens in democratic processes, to a greater extent than the other two Intermediate Results.</span>","Evaluated task order title: Country development cooperation strategy (CDCS) development objective 1 evaluation, inclusive and accountable democracy ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Country development cooperation strategy (CDCS) development objective 1",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-486-I-14-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ 72011518F00001,,10/1/2018 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Democracy ~|~_©_~|~ Elections ~|~_©_~|~ Gender equity ~|~_©_~|~ Parliamentary systems ~|~_©_~|~ Political participation ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion ~|~_©_~|~ Youth,Kyrgyzstan,AID-486-I-14-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ 72011518F00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TFNH.pdf,1395 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008870 - USAID.

PA-00T-FNF,"This evaluation is commissioned by the U.S. Agency for International Development in Bosnia and Herzegovina (USAID/BiH), in line with USAIDs Evaluation Policy, to examine the USAID/BiH 2013-2017 reconciliation intervention Trust, Understanding, and Responsibility for the Future Activity (PRO-Future). PRO-Futures goal is to increase interethnic trust in BiH by helping citizens understand and accept each others narratives of the past (expected outcome 1), and by engaging key influencers in supporting local reconciliation initiatives (expected outcome 2). The interventions underlying development hypothesis is: if BiH citizens accept alternative political and historical narratives, supported by key influencers, they will change their individual attitudes and behaviors toward one another, resulting in increased social trust within communities, enabling citizens to work together to overcome societal divisions and constructively advocate for institutional changes, which in turn will lead to social well-being and economic prosperity. This impact and performance evaluation answers four questions, informed by the main elements of PRO-Futures development hypothesis (evaluation questions 1 and 2) and two main expected outcomes (evaluation questions 3 and 4). The first two questions examine PRO-Futures impact on interethnic attitudes and trust in participating municipalities/cities, while the third and fourth question examine progress toward achieving the two expected outcomes. The evaluation team employed a mixed-methods approach. For the impact portion of the evaluation (evaluation questions 1 and 2), three different household surveys were combined: the PRO-Future baseline survey and the Social Cohesion and Reconciliation Index for BiH (both conducted in early 2014, with sample sizes of 3,000 and 2,000 households respectively), and the PRO-Future end-line survey (conducted in the spring of 2017 with a sample size of 4,200 households). The impact analysis was conducted by using the difference-in-differences method to examine the impact of PRO-Future on interethnic attitudes and trust within the 30 municipalities in which PRO-Future has been implemented, compared to the regions in which PRO-Future has not been implemented. The study of implementation and perceived performance (evaluation questions 3 and 4) used the PRO-Future documentation and database, 65 key informant semi-structured interviews, four focus groups with 22 participants, and an online survey of 431 PRO-Future beneficiaries. Our evaluation does not find any significant overall impact on either attitudes or trust when examining all ethnic groups together, while calculations for the three ethnicities separately found different impacts for each, including different significance levels, direction, and magnitude of impact. This indicates that further research should be done on an approach to reconciliation interventions and its potential customization based on differences between ethnicities. Despite the inconclusive/ambiguous conclusions about PRO-Futures overall impact, all stakeholders directly included in PRO-Future who spoke to the evaluation team perceived PRO-Future as useful and having a positive influence. This seeming dichotomy indicates that PRO-Future has had an important influence but on narrow groups and types of citizens. This is further confirmed in interviews/focus group discussions, in which most note that PRO-Futures reach was mostly toward a narrow group of the most active and open citizens, such as CSO members and activists. Our evaluation concludes that reconciliation initiatives should be continued in BiH to build on and expand the reach of the considerable achievements of PRO-Future. The evaluation conclusions related to needs for specific adjustments of any potential future reconciliation interventions based on lessons learned from PRO-Future include: i) grounding interventions more extensively in psychological theory and in a clearer and simpler logical framework; ii) considering a more systematic way of targeting beneficiaries/participants aiming to reach less receptive groups iii) focusing on fewer localities with more intensity and with a further customized and sequenced approach considering locality specificities, iv) continuing with small grant allocation, v) focusing on activities that combine a reconciliation/peace-building component with interethnic interaction based on common local/target group interest to attract broader participation; vi) continuing with the speaking-out events as the most effective type of activity in influencing participants individual, personal transformation, vii) strengthening key influencers engagement with a focus on high-level and local politicians, religious leaders, and mainstream media; and viii) working on designing specific and actionable tasks to be implemented by the government based on the Platform for Peace signed within PRO-Future.","Evaluated project title: Trust, understanding, and responsibility for the future activity (PRO-Future) ~|~_©_~|~ COR: Elma Bukvic Jusic",Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-168-C-14-00003,,9/1/2017 0:00,,Arts ~|~_©_~|~ Ethnic groups ~|~_©_~|~ Journalism ~|~_©_~|~ Leadership training ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion ~|~_©_~|~ Sociology ~|~_©_~|~ Sports ~|~_©_~|~ War,Bosnia and Hercegovina,AID-168-A-13-00007,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TFNF.pdf,2120 KB,"041024 - IMPAQ International, LLC",,009954 - USAID.

PA-00T-FD7,"<span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">The purpose of the mid-term evaluation of the Water Resources Integration Development Initiative (WARIDI) is assessing progress towards target results and examining the methods of project implementation, both of which will inform time-sensitive course correction and future design. WARIDI s goal is improved water resources management and service access across multiple sectors. Activities are implemented in selected districts of the Rufiji and Wami-Ruvu river basins in Tanzania. The evaluation team (ET) used a mixed methods approach, which included analyzing project documents and monitoring data, and gathering information through key informant interviews and focus group discussions with stakeholders involved in, or benefitting from, WARIDIs interventions. Using multiple sources of data allowed the ET to triangulate information for cross-validation and gain better understanding of issues from different perspectives. The evaluation found that, in general, WARIDI is well regarded as contributing to improved sustainability in water resources management. However, due to an early underestimation of the complexity and time needed to establish and scale-up activitiesespecially regarding Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH)many targets will not be met. The program has done an excellent job integrating women and youth into programming but suffers from a lack of resources for the critical component oneWASH services. Allocating much more funding to this component should be a priority. The Leading with Sanitation approach has been effective in alerting communities that they require latrines before receiving other project benefits.

PA-00T-FBR,"<div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/Cambodia launched its Countering Trafficking-In-Persons Activity in nine provinces in 2015 in response to unsafe migration and exploitation concerns. In 2018, The Mitchell Group, Inc. conducted a mid-term performance evaluation in five provinces on prevention interventions. The evaluation included a desk review and six weeks of mixed-methods data collection, including a survey to 504 participants. The focus was on four key evaluation questions: (1) whether CTIP prevention activities contribute to increasing safe migration and/or sufficient livelihoods as a measure to reduce migration; (2) identifying unintended consequences that affected performance; (3) providing actionable recommendations; and (4) documenting lessons learned in design and management. Overall, CTIP is contributing to safe migration and improving the livelihoods of low-skilled and low-educated beneficiaries in order to give them alternative options, such as documented migration or domestic migration. This mid-term result is being achieved by deploying effective models based on previous extensive research and experience, such as multiple income sources, integrated farming, and savings groups, which are improving levels of income sufficiency, improving living conditions, and significantly improving the awareness of TIP-related issues. The evaluation teams recommendations include:</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;""> Strengthening livelihood diversification and the use of updated, innovative techniques through international technical assistance, exchange learning programs, and integrated models of support;</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;""> Continue its plan for an extensive review of Bong Pheak, its M&amp;E approaches, and its worker satisfaction surveys;</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;""> Continue its plan to assess the effects of its 2018 BCC strategy in 2019 to consider upscaling to other provinces.</span></div>",Evqaluated project title: Cambodia countering trafficking-In-persons (CTIP) ~|~_©_~|~ COR: Peoulida Ros,Special Evaluation,Documents,72044218F00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-15-00028,,12/1/2018 0:00,,Communes ~|~_©_~|~ Farms ~|~_©_~|~ Gender equity ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Income ~|~_©_~|~ Savings ~|~_©_~|~ Trafficking in persons (TIP) ~|~_©_~|~ Violence against women,Cambodia,AID-442-A-15-000002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TFBR.pdf,2902 KB,"008360 - The Mitchell Group, Inc.

PA-00T-F6K,"<div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">This performance evaluation of the USAID/Sweden Fostering Agricultural Markets Activity II (FARMA II) assesses progress on the Activitys contractual obligations to date. FARMA II is currently near the midpoint of implementation and based on the evaluation findings, conclusions, and recommendations from this evaluation, USAID/Sweden will be able to make adjustments to the Activity as needed. The evaluation focuses on four research questions. The first question examines FARMA IIs progress to date on key performance indicators and the prospects for meeting life of Activity targets. The second question examines whether the approach included in FARMA IIs 2017 work plan, which includes the addition of AgMentor, has produced results on key indicators and how this approach has been implemented. The third question examines how public sector stakeholders perceive the relevance of FARMA II and how the Activitys assistance to this group has been implemented. Finally, the fourth evaluation question assesses whether FARMA IIs TA has led to progress in the adoption of the Rural Development Strategy and how this assistance has been implemented.</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">&nbsp;</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">The evaluation team employed a mixed methods approach to answer each of the evaluation questions through triangulation. In addition to reviewing FARMA II documentation, the team conducted 74 semi-structured interviews and conducted an online survey of FARMA II producer organization (PO) beneficiaries. This evaluation</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">shows that it is likely that given past and present growth trends, FARMA IIs export and jobs targets will be met at the end of the Activitys implementation. Reaching the sales-related life of activity targets will prove to be a more challenging task since FARMA II has underperformed on these indicators and the other beneficiary POs that have the potential to move into the assisted beneficiary category are relatively small compared to the existing pool of assisted beneficiaries. Therefore, it is expected that the rate of progress toward life of activity targets on performance indicators related to business results will slow in the coming years.</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">&nbsp;</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">Generally, beneficiaries are satisfied with the technical assistance (TA) provided by FARMA II and feel that it meets their business needs. Additionally, all types of TA provided by FARMA II are perceived as useful. However, among some beneficiaries, FARMA IIs approach to TA delivery is not perceived as demand driven. Additionally, many beneficiaries are not familiar with FARMA IIs TA options, approach, and strategy. To expand their reach, FARMA IIs 2017 approach relies on the multiplication of TA through AgMentor. While most stakeholders believe this could be a useful channel to access information, knowledge, and extension and advisory services, there are concerns about implementation to date, ownership, and sustainability.</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">&nbsp;</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">There was satisfaction with the public-sector certification and training received from FARMA II and many stakeholders noted that there was effective communication and collaboration with FARMA II around this TA. However, among others, there were higher expectations of the scope of assistance that would be provided and the extent to which demands would be addressed.

PA-00T-F2C,"<span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">The Food Security Service Center (FSSC) is a five-year activity implemented by Social Impact (SI) in support of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Bureau for Food Security (BFS). Through the FSSC, SI provides consultancy services to Feed the Future countries and to BFS home offices. The FSSC evaluation assessed the efficiency and effectiveness of FSSCs operations and how well its services filled technical skills gaps at requesting organizations. The evaluation used a mixed-methods approach consisting of: a document review; key informant interviews and a web-based survey with key FSSC stakeholders; analysis of the FSSC consultants technical order logs and Statements of Work; and analysis of consultant feedback forms. The FSSC successfully completed 157 consultancy assignments that filled critical short-term skills gaps at USAID Missions and BFS. Demand for FSSC services evolved organically according to the needs of requesting organizations but was focused on technical assistance in inclusive agricultural systems, sustainable productive agricultural practices, consumption of nutritious and safe diets, proactive risk reduction, and access to markets and trade. Technical services provided by FSSC consultants included, in order of importance: project design; expert assessment and analysis; cross-cutting technical support services; strategic planning; monitoring, learning and evaluation; communications; and technical writing. SI support to consultants is efficient, effective, responsive, and flexible, and both requesting organizations and consultants are highly satisfied with the FSSC. FSSC has not encountered significant operational challenges and is a success by all metrics. Only incremental adjustments are required to enhance its operations moving forward.</span>",Evaluated project title: Food security service center (FSSC) ~|~_©_~|~ COR: Lesley Perlman,Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-TO-16-00008 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-1-15-00024,,10/1/2018 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Demand ~|~_©_~|~ Food ~|~_©_~|~ Food production ~|~_©_~|~ Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Gender equality ~|~_©_~|~ Infant nutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Learning readiness,East Africa ~|~_©_~|~ West Africa,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TF2C.pdf,1197 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates,,013469 - USAID.

PA-00T-DV1,"The purpose of the evaluation of Strengthening Human Resources for Health (SHRH) Activity was to assess Activity progress and inform design for future Activities. The evaluation used mixed methods to answer five evaluation questions: (1) In what ways did the SHRH Activity contribute to improving human resources for health (HRH) and strengthening the regulatory environment in Ethiopia? (2) Did the Activity interventions facilitate local ownership, coordination and partnerships, and sustainability? (3) Were gender issues addressed in pre-service and in-service training? (4) Have Activity result/sub-result areas and interventions continued to be relevant to HRH gaps and challenges in Ethiopia? (5) Were there any facilitating and hindering factors? The SHRH Activity contributed to improved human resource management and quality of training in Oromia. Currently, Debre-Tabor University is ahead of its peers in the quality of its training. The SHRH Activity supported the federal regulatory agencies. However, the private sector continued to be more highly regulated than the public sector. Many of the Activitys interventions were sustainable, but research and program learning interventions had limited local ownership and will not be sustained. The Activity made contributions to address gender issues in pre-service education, but not with in-service training. Human resource management, quality improvement, and research were found to be the most relevant interventions for HRH. The SHRH Activity support was a key driver of change for HRH in Ethiopia, and where there were high levels of ownership, commitment, and leadership among the different levels of management at the Ministry, Regional, University, and Health Science Colleges, there was better performance.",Evaluated project title: Strengthening human resources for health (SHRH),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-663-C-16-00010,,11/1/2018 0:00,,Data collection ~|~_©_~|~ Health workers ~|~_©_~|~ Institutional sustainability ~|~_©_~|~ Learning readiness ~|~_©_~|~ Life skills ~|~_©_~|~ Ownership ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Students,Ethiopia,AID-663-A-12-00008,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TDV1.pdf,1934 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008543 - USAID.

PA-00T-DP5,"<p class=""p1"">The goal of this evaluation is to assess the progress of CHC, including what has worked well and what has not, and to make recommendations that inform the design of a follow-on project. This evaluation explores how CHC's design and implementation played a role in behavioral outcomes, how CHC coordination structures worked and contributed to increased capacity in SBCC, and how CHC has been able to generate and share evidence of effective SBCC practices with stakeholders.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class=""p2"">The evaluation followed a mixed method, non-experimental evaluation design, relying predominantly on qualitative data supported by quantitative evidence from both the national Lot Quality Assurance Sampling survey (LQAS) and CHCs own Phase I/baseline and Phase II/endline surveys to understand what worked with respect to CHC, how and where it worked, and why.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class=""p2"">Findings showed CHC used 360-degree communication to saturate the national and local media and leverage community- and facility-based communication channels. This resulted in very high levels of message recall. <em>Obulamu </em>(a national media campaign) can be found everywhere. In terms of coordination, two of CHCs biggest achievements were: 1) helping to revitalize the SBCC technical working group (TWG) at the Ministry of Health (MoH) making it communication-focused as opposed to content-focused; and 2) streamlining the process by which SBCC materials get approved by the MoHs Health Promotion and Education (HPE) Department. These achievements were highly valued by the MoH and partners. At the same time, coordination was affected by competing priorities of IPs who also had their own objectives, plans, and targets which sometimes did not segue smoothly with those of CHC. Additionally, goal posts were often moved in response to PEPFAR, many targets for which changed annually<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p>",Evaluated project title: Communications for healthy communities (CHC),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-617-C-13-00007,,4/1/2018 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Case management ~|~_©_~|~ Coordinating ~|~_©_~|~ Coordination ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Health care costs ~|~_©_~|~ Infant nutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Knowledge,Uganda,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TDP5.pdf,2747 KB,"011976 - QED Group, LLC",,008618 - USAID.

The findings demonstrate that community leadership and engagement during grant implementation are the biggest keys for fostering long-term project sustainability and future community-led development.</div>",Evaluated project title: Small project assistance (SPA),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-PPL-T-12-00002,,10/1/2018 0:00,,Children ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Girls ~|~_©_~|~ Learning readiness ~|~_©_~|~ Mathematics ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion ~|~_©_~|~ Sanitation education ~|~_©_~|~ Water sanitation,Rwanda ~|~_©_~|~ Malawi ~|~_©_~|~ Morocco ~|~_©_~|~ Philippines ~|~_©_~|~ Peru,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TCW4.pdf,3872 KB,041835 - General Dynamics Information Technology (GDIT),,"013858 - USAID.

PA-00T-CQ1,"<div>This study estimated the impacts of Amazonía Lee, an early grade reading program in Peru delivering in-service teacher training, coaching, and materials as well as leadership training and non-monetary incentives to improve reading instruction. We examined impacts on teaching practices and literacy skills of participating students. We randomly assigned schools to a program group that implemented Amazonía Lee or a control group that did not. The study was conducted in two areas (departments) of the Amazon region. In one department, Ucayali, control schools received the usual services provided by the Ministry of Education. In the other department, San Martín, most control schools received a program known as Soporte Pedagógico, a Ministry initiative that offered teacher training and coaching, pedagogical materials, and remedial tutoring.<br /><br /></div> <div>In both regions, we found a few impacts on teacher instructional practices, including teachers increased explanation of different types of texts and greater vocabulary development. The impacts on students differed by region. In Ucayali, Amazonía Lee had positive and substantial impacts on reading outcomes. For example, students in Amazonia Lee on average could read one additional familiar word (7 versus 6, an impact equivalent to 0.24 standard deviations), 3.5 additional invented words (16.8 versus 13.4, an impact on decoding of 0.24 standard deviations), and scored higher on a reading comprehension test (impact of 0.27 standard deviations), with no gender differences. In San Martín, where Soporte Pedagógico was prevalent, we found no impacts on students reading outcomes relative to the control schools.</div>",Evaluated project title:  Amazonia lee (Amazon reads),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-M-12-00020,,1/1/2018 0:00,,Children ~|~_©_~|~ Classrooms ~|~_©_~|~ Demonstration ~|~_©_~|~ Learning readiness ~|~_©_~|~ Literacy ~|~_©_~|~ Materials ~|~_©_~|~ Mathematics ~|~_©_~|~ Students,Peru,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TCQ1.pdf,4435 KB,"000764 - Mathematica Policy Research, Inc.",,009839 - USAID.

PA-00T-CN9,"<div>The Advancing Partners &amp; Communities (APC) Project is a five-year USAID cooperative agreement with the John Snow, Inc. Research &amp; Training Institute, in collaboration with FHI 360, funded from October 2012, with a two-year extension until September 2019. This evaluation assessed the extent to which APC has achieved its objectives and identified community-based family planning (CBFP) activities that might warrant future investment. The evaluation questions examined APCs global leadership and advocacy for CBFP, its sub-grant program, and its efforts to strengthen the capacity of private voluntary organizations/nongovernmental organizations to implement effective programs. USAID will use the evaluation to inform future programming.</div> <div>The evaluation team visited APC projects in Benin and Uganda, conducting 114 key informant interviews, online surveys of Missions and grantees, and group discussions with health workers and clients. Key APC achievements included global- and country-level support for family planning (FP) and CBFP in 16 FP projects and implementation of HIV/AIDs, post-Ebola, and other health initiatives in 38 countries. CBFP advocacy focused on the global and country levels, where it promoted innovative CBFP programs, networking with local partners to advocate for changing policy/regulations in several African countries to allow community health workers to inject depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), to improve drug shops provision of injectable contraceptives, and ensure links to FP within broader community health policy agendas.</div> <div>Testing the efficacy of self-injection of subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) was a major achievement; however, global advocacy for CBFP was not as focused. Key recommendations include improving monitoring and evaluation of sub-grants and related activities and continuing to collaborate with USAID and global partners to ensure wide and effective CBFP advocacy.</div>",Evaluated task order title: Advancing partners & communities (APC) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health program cycle improvement (GH Pro),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,,10/1/2018 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Family health care ~|~_©_~|~ Family planning behavior ~|~_©_~|~ Leadership training ~|~_©_~|~ Youth,Uganda ~|~_©_~|~ Africa south of Sahara ~|~_©_~|~ Benin,AID-OAA-A-12-00047,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TCN9.pdf,1834 KB,040668 - Dexis Consulting Group,,011262 - USAID.

PA-00T-CJZ,"BALADI CAP is a $14.9 million civil society support project of USAID/Lebanon that aims to build management capacity of CSOs so they can directly manage USAID grants; to build municipal capacity; and to support civic advocacy. This mid-term performance evaluation of the project found that BALADI CAPs Capacity Building Component (CBC) improved management capacity, and 27 CSOs are expected to have capacity to manage USAID grants by the end of the program. Trained individuals and organizations are expected to be able to conduct future CSO training. Implementation of the Civic Engagement for Democracy Governance (CEDG) component was delayed and its effectiveness could not be evaluated. For-profit CEDG service providers are sustainable; it is unclear whether there is a market for CSO-provided services. Grants through the Civic Engagement Initiative (CEI) promoted advocacy capacity in 12 CSOs, though training did not benefit all CSOs and advocacy networks did not improve advocacy. Universities represent the most sustainable institutions to provide future advocacy training.

More effective interventions included social dialogue activities (Faces of Takamol, Slam Poetry, 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-based Violence campaigns), King Abdullah II Award gender criteria, and integration of youth, among others. Within policy and advocacy, USG-funding stipulations and Takamols technical assistance strengthened the capacity of the Jordan National Commission for Women (JNCW) to an extent. Activities leveraging internal government mechanisms proved more effective and a promising avenue for gender mainstreaming. Less effective aspects of Takamol related to some elements of training, communication and follow-up. Takamol provided valuable trainings, but did not adequately tailor all trainings to participant levels. Inconsistent communication and follow-up also limited greater effectiveness of capacity building and partnerships. Related to synergy, successes were noted under two USAID DOs. External factors affecting Takamols performance included high turnover of government leadership, and limited coordination from USAID affecting synergy with IPs. Beyond the life of Takamol, the capacity of current strategic partners will likely affect sustainability. Takamol has established a high level of credibility to continue to address gender issues, but lessons learned highlight the need to focus and strategize to ensure activities are well connected, and support sustainability.</div>",Evaluated project title: Takamol,Special Evaluation,Documents,AID 278-A-14-00001,,5/1/2017 0:00,,Empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Gender equality ~|~_©_~|~ Institutional sustainability ~|~_©_~|~ Leadership training ~|~_©_~|~ Learning readiness ~|~_©_~|~ Violence against women ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Jordan,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TCHH.pdf,1361 KB,"003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

The purpose of the evaluation was to determine: 1) how well the Project components worked; 2) strengths and weaknesses of the Project; and 3) gaps inhibiting project achievements.<br /><br /></div> <div>The USAID/Central Asia HIV Flagship Project was successful in rolling out a new approach to HIV programming in Central Asia, focused on case detection, treatment initiation, and adherence. Peer-driven rapid HIV testing in community settings has significantly broadened access to testing for people who inject drugs (PWID) and their sexual partners. Large numbers have been tested, although ambitious targets were not met (66,747 HIV tests versus a target of 77,321). The overall HIV-positive, case-detection yield of 1.8 percent is well below expectations given the estimated HIV prevalence among PWID. The Project needs to expand testing to new networks of PWID not currently reached and undertake more testing among former PWID. The Projects case management has made a significant contribution to antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation, adherence, and retention in care, but there is still a significant gap between the number of new cases detected and the number of people who have initiated ART. Of the 1,192 newly found people living with HIV (PLHIV) through case detection, 735 (61.7 percent) commenced ART. The Project also supports ART re-/initiation by 2,132 loss to follow-up clients and PLHIV referred to the Project by AIDS Centers. While structural barriers play a significant part in limiting ART initiation, factors within the Projects control are improving the quality of pre-test counseling, including treatment education and motivational skills of case managers.</div>",Evaluated project title: Global health program cycle improvement project (GH Pro),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,,10/1/2018 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Case management ~|~_©_~|~ Crimes ~|~_©_~|~ Discrimination ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Internet ~|~_©_~|~ USAID,Eurasia ~|~_©_~|~ Central and Eastern Europe ~|~_©_~|~ Tajikistan,AID-176-C-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TCDT.pdf,1658 KB,040668 - Dexis Consulting Group,,010822 - USAID.

PA-00T-C92,"This mid-term performance evaluation of the USAID/Nepals Civil Society: Mutual Accountability Project (CS:MAP) employed a mixed method approach to assess the interventions, processes, and approaches in the changed governance context and recommend future actions for course correction for optimum utility of the remaining project period. The evaluation team reached out to a total of 248 respondents; 176 males and 72 females using key informant interviews, group interviews, focus group discussions, and mini-surveys to answer six evaluation questions. Based on the evidence collected, the evaluation team concludes that while the current activities have had some demonstrable successes, CS:MAP has yet to contribute substantially to achieving the project goal: to foster a more legitimate, accountable and resilient Nepali civil society that is capable of advancing the public interest. This may be due to the evolution of the changing governance structures and thereby the gap generated between the original vision of the project and the changed reality. The shift from a long-standing centralized system of governance to a decentralized federalist system required elections for sub-national officials and a considerable shift in authority, decision-making and bureaucratic processes. The evaluation team finds, however, that CS:MAP leadership has yet to adjust the project to maximize opportunities or capitalize on leverage points across objectives that may have further entrenched or reinforced project goals and objectives. Based on the evaluation teams findings, the team recommends that USAID and CS:MAP leadership undertake a review of the current projects scope, including partnerships, activities and locations (districts and wards) to determine if a more effective design could be developed to more closely achieve results and objectives as stated in the current project logical framework.","Evaluated task order title: Civil society : mutual accountability project (CS:MAP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL)",Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-367-C-15-00001,,9/1/2018 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Elections ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Gender equality ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Local level ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion,Nepal,AID-367-A-16-00007,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TC92.pdf,2413 KB,011830 - CAMRIS International,,008583 - USAID.

Implementing partner Tetra Tech provides USAID with engineering support, quality control, and other technical services for off-budget and on-budget projects in diverse sectors, including Energy, Vertical Structures, Transportation, Water, Irrigation, Sanitation, as well as support to Capacity-Building activities, including a female internship program. The evaluation team spent 35 days in-country reviewing documentation and conducting interviews, including 90 key informant interviews, 11 focus group discussions with 53 participants, and a survey of 53 Engineers and Technicians. Findings are that the Engineering Support Program has competent, skilled, and experienced staff - both expatriate and Afghan, however, the program has not performed to-date at the level expected. The evaluation team raised concerns over the contractors lack of responsiveness to the needs and protocols of USAID, Government of Afghanistan entities, and private sector contractors, as well as its inflexibility in adapting to the constraints of Afghanistan. The Engineering Support Program has also not capacitated Afghan counterparts as expected.

PA-00T-C2S,"The purpose of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Collaborative Research on Aquaculture &amp; Fisheries (AquaFish IL) is to expand research and the pool of researchers pursuing topics relevant to the primary thematic areas of aquaculture and fisheries. The AquaFish IL evaluation provides evidence-based findings and recommendations that USAID can use to inform and improve future investments in aquaculture and fisheries research to better achieve intended outcomes. The evaluation used document review and key informant interviews to answer questions related to the Management Entitys (ME) effectiveness in project implementation; coordination and communication; generation of quality research and collaborations; response to requests for technical assistance; and generation and development of the research technologies with greatest potential for future development. The evaluation found that, across most areas, the program performed well. AquaFish IL produced quality research through 103 peer-reviewed publications by the time of this evaluation. Another 40 to 50 were in preparation. AquaFish IL supported over 275 long-term degree-seeking students (51 percent women) and provided short-term training for over 2,000 participants (45 percent women). It also produced innovative technologies, including developing Pangasius culture in hyposaline conditions in Bangladesh. However, the ME had limited success in forging strong relationships with USAID Missions. This was partly because the Mission staff had time constraints, which limited their engagement. Interviewees recommended that fish feeds and feeding, production systems and management, mobile phone-based technologies, and air-breathing and indigenous fishes merit future research as they are high priorities for host countries participating in AquaFish IL.",Evaluated task order title: Feed the Future Innovation Lab for collaborative research on aquaculture & fisheries (AquaFish IL) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Program evaluation for effectiveness and learning (PEEL),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-TO-16-00008 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-1-12-00024,,9/1/2018 0:00,,Agricultural technology ~|~_©_~|~ Aquaculture ~|~_©_~|~ Coastal fisheries ~|~_©_~|~ Demonstration ~|~_©_~|~ Fisheries ~|~_©_~|~ Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Institutional sustainability ~|~_©_~|~ Learning readiness,Nepal ~|~_©_~|~ Cambodia ~|~_©_~|~ Vietnam ~|~_©_~|~ Tanzania ~|~_©_~|~ Ghana ~|~_©_~|~ Bangladesh ~|~_©_~|~ Kenya ~|~_©_~|~ Uganda,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TC2S.pdf,1525 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates,,013469 - USAID.

PA-00T-9T3,"We present the results of a study designed to benchmark a major USAID-funded child malnutrition program against what would have occurred if the cost of the program had simply been disbursed directly to beneficiaries to spend as they see fit. Using a three-armed trial from 248 villages in Rwanda, the study measures impacts on households containing poor or malnourished children, or pregnant or lactating women, as well as the broader population of study villages. We find that the bundled health program delivers benefits in an outcome directly targeted by specific sub-components of the intervention (savings), but does not improve dietary diversity, child anthropometrics, or anemia within the year of the study. A cost-equivalent cash transfer boosts productive asset investment and allows households to pay down debt. The bundled program is significantly better in cost-equivalent terms at generating savings and worse for debt reduction. A much larger cash transfer of more than $500 per household improves a wide range of consumption measures including dietary diversity, as well as higher savings, assets, and housing values. Only the large cash transfer shows evidence of moving child outcomes, with modest effects on anthropometrics (significant at or just below the 10% level). The results indicate that programs targeted towards driving specific outcomes can do so at lower cost than cash, but large cash transfers drive substantial benefits across a wide range of impacts, including many of those targeted by the more tailored program.",Evaluated task order title: Development impact lab ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Higher education solutions network  (HESN),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-A-13-00002,,6/1/2018 0:00,,Business enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Child malnutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Health care costs ~|~_©_~|~ Households ~|~_©_~|~ Infant nutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Savings ~|~_©_~|~ Villages,Rwanda,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T9T3.pdf,4386 KB,"000320 - University of California, Berkeley",,040693 - U.S. Global Development Lab (GDL),English,application/pdf,,,"McIntosh, Craig ~|~_©_~|~ Zeitlin, Andrew",Child nutrition,Jun-18,,,,Impact evaluation report : benchmarking a child nutrition program against cash : experimental evidence from an evaluation in Rwanda,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=NTExODE0,Rwanda,,,2018-06-01,2018,RWA,RWA_2018,0.631184145450926,0.652186330018765,0.36050156739811895,0.662475097656984,0.139154968093823,,,0.199080424870463,0.569403481118605,0.319294060840909,0.158910329171396,0.5251842471839749,,0.556493897178213,0.8102511001812058,,0.554744525547445,RWA,2018,1.0,0.5571249075319886,3.0,0.3994449613598424,BFA_2014,MOZ_2016,LBR_2016,MOZ_2014,MLI_2014

PA-00T-9NZ,"Executed by Tetra Tech Associates in Rural Development from January 2013 to October 2018, United States Agency for International Development/Haitis Limiyé ak Òganizasyon pou Kolektivite yo ale Lwen (LOKAL+) project sought to increase communal government legitimacy through improved governance and improved service delivery in nine target communes by increasing local government technical and management capacity. This evaluation assessed the projects: 1) relevance to Government of Haiti concerns and needs; 2) effectiveness in improving three domains: accountability, transparency (see Annex I for definitions), and service delivery; and 3) sustainability of improving governance in target communes. Methods included a document review, 29 key and group informant interviews (involving 50 officials), 35 focus group discussions (involving 162 female and 168 male citizens), and 12 direct observation site visits in target communes. Almost all stakeholders stated that LOKAL+ was very effective in improving accountability, transparency, and service delivery, especially for tax collection and sanitation. However, except for a sizeable minority in St. Marc, Carrefour, and Cap Haitian, respondents felt that communes have no capacity to independently continue improved governance in these three domains. Nonetheless, given Haitis historically highly centralized and opaque local governance, it is important to note three fundamentally important changes brought about by the project: 1) LOKAL+ has demonstrated that it is possible for communes to be financially sound and administratively autonomous; 2) it has introduced the notion of transparency to municipal citizens; and 3) it has successfully improved critical administrative systems such as tax collection administration, housing census, and database management.",Footer title: Final evaluation report ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Limiye ak oganizasyon pou kolektivite yo ale lwen (LOKAL+),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-521-C-17-00002,,7/1/2018 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Communes ~|~_©_~|~ Decentralization ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Local level ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Transparency ~|~_©_~|~ Violence against women,Haiti,AID-521-C-13-00004,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T9NZ.pdf,1258 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008554 - USAID.

PA-00T-9JC,"International Business &amp; Technical Consultants, Inc. conducted a final performance evaluation of two USAID activities: Libya Elections and Governance Support, implemented by the Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening since October 2012, and Supporting Consensus Building for the National Dialogue, Constitution Drafting and Governing Process in Libya, implemented by the American Bar Association since August 2014. The purpose of the evaluation was to capture information from the inception of the activities through May 2018 on the diverse areas in which the two activities were able to achieve real impact and promote meaningful change despite the challenging operating environment. The evaluation questions addressed the following: a) progress made toward the activity objectives; b) achievements that were not part of the work plans; and c) program design for effectively adapting to local challenges. The evaluation used a non-experimental design that employed both qualitative and quantitative methods, including 64 semi-structured key informant interviews; 4 focus group discussions; and a face-to-face survey of 1192 households. The key conclusions were: <br />? Relatively high public confidence in elections, in large part due to the capacity built by USAID of the High National Election Commission <br />? Willingness among national and municipal legislators receiving USAID assistance to factor citizen input into their work <br />? Although the concept of advocacy is still new, womens and marginalized groups supported by USAID successfully advocated issues <br />? Citizens effectively informed and engaged in the constitution drafting process<br /> ?

PA-00T-9HS,"<p class=""p1"">USAID/Georgia began a five-year project entitled Strengthening Elections and Political Processes (SEPPs) in 2014, two years after the first peaceful transfer of power in the country, at what looked like a promising time for the development of Georgias democratic political processes. This evaluation explores the performance of this effort based on the progress that had been accomplished towards its objectives and ultimate goal. The overarching goal of the project  Georgia's democratic electoral and political processes are deepened and institutionalized was pursued through three objectives: strengthening of political parties, improvement of government capacity to administer and oversee free and fair electoral processes, and enhancement of civic engagement and national consensus around electoral and political processes. These objectives were pursued via interventions implemented by three international (IFES, IRI, and NDI) and three local (ISFED, GYLA, and TI-Georgia) partners. The evaluation addressed five primary questions specified by USAID: Did the performance of the projects six activities meet expectations and achieve expected results? Were there gaps in achieving the three objectives? Did the activities meet the expectations of their direct beneficiaries? Were the projects goals feasible given the ability of USAID to influence? Did the project offer lessons learned from utilizing local partners? The evaluation team adopted a multi-faceted and mixed-method approach to its evaluation. This approach included extensive documentary research, interviews with the implementing partners, and three primary evidence-based research methods with stakeholders: semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and a mini-survey. The evaluation established that the projects objectives and subobjectives are generally on target to be met. However, there are structural issues in Georgias political system that continue to hinder political competition. In this context, it will be critical for USAID going forward to tackle the more fundamental objective of making political competition an acceptable and assumed part of the Georgian political system.</p>",Evaluated project title: Strengthening electoral and political processes project (SEPPS),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,72011418P00026,,8/1/2018 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Democracy ~|~_©_~|~ Elections ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Political participation ~|~_©_~|~ Political parties ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion ~|~_©_~|~ Voting,Georgia,AID-114-LA-14-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-114-LA-14-00006 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-114-LA-14-00005 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-114-A-16-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-114-A-16-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-114-F-16-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T9HS.pdf,10237 KB,009831 - Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening (CEPPS),,009620 - USAID.

PA-00T-96B,"The Promoting the Quality of Medicines (PQM) program, a USAID cooperative agreement (20092019) with the United States Pharmacopeial Convention, a nonprofit organization, aims to help assure the quality, safety, and efficacy of medicines of relevance to USAID health programs. It is the Agencys response to the growing development challenge posed by substandard and falsified medicines worldwide. The purposes of this interim evaluation were to determine the effectiveness of PQMs implementation in achieving the program goal and intermediate results, and to provide prioritized recommendations that can be feasibly incorporated into the remainder of the existing program. The evaluation team used qualitative and quantitative data collection methods and analysis methods, including document reviews, online surveys, and in-person and remote interviews, and site visits to PQM programs in Indonesia, Nigeria, and Ethiopia. Important outcomes of PQMs work were identified in strengthening medicines quality assurance systems and increasing the supply of quality-assured priority global health medicines. While the program faced and successfully addressed many management and technical challenges as it grew in size and complexity over its first eight years of implementation, these challenges at times affected its ability to devote time to effectively communicate its goal, technical approaches, and achievements to clients and stakeholders. The evaluation team had four recommendations for PQM: develop a comprehensive and strategic communications strategy; continue to develop the results framework with a pathway of change; focus on implementation of the information management component of the knowledge management strategy; and adopt and integrate systems thinking and system theory approaches.","""Evaluation assignment number: 444"" ~|~_©_~|~ Footer title: Interim performance evaluation of the promoting the quality of medicines (PQM) program ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order title: Global health program cycle improvement (GH Pro) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title:  Promoting the quality of medicines (PQM)",Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,,8/1/2018 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Laboratories ~|~_©_~|~ Manufacturing ~|~_©_~|~ Pharmaceuticals ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Tuberculosis,Indonesia ~|~_©_~|~ Africa south of Sahara ~|~_©_~|~ Nigeria,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T96B.pdf,4643 KB,040668 - Dexis Consulting Group,,040221 - USAID.

PA-00T-91M,"This mid-term performance evaluation of the USAID/Colombia Human Rights Activity employs a qualitative methodology to assess HRAs advancements towards its intended outcomes, relevance in the changing human rights context, and promotion of sustainability of its activities. The evaluation team conducted 136 key informant interviews and 15 group discussions to answer six evaluation questions. The evaluation found that HRA remains relevant through its regional presence and technical and contextual expertise. While HRA has incorporated activities that adequately respond to the institutional challenges that governmental entities face, there are particular strategies that can be strengthened, including issues on illegal mining, targeting Afro-Colombians, and protecting human rights leaders and defenders. HRA has contributed to and improved understanding of human rights standards among the most relevant municipal government officials and vulnerable beneficiary groups. The additional effects on beneficiaries include leadership, empowerment, and self-esteem at the individual level, which spill over into strengthening civil society and their community and family spheres. HRAs institutional strengthening strategy is oriented toward sustainability through its emphasis on supporting activities and processes linked to public policy. However, two challenges under HRAs control undermine the sustainability of its activities: 1) intensive technical assistance runs the risk of creating dependency from government officials on its regional advisors, and 2) short-term grants limit CSOs from fully implementing their projects. Finally, HRA has limited capacity and a constrained sphere of influence to achieve the objectives of its response component under the status quo. In the absence of high-level discussions between USAID and AGO officials, HRA has been strategic in approaching the AGO. However, this has resulted in a piecemeal strategy rather than a high-level comprehensive strategy that aligns with the ambitious objective of this component.",Evaluated task order title: Human rights activity (HRA) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Evaluation and analysis for learning (EVAL),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-514-C-13-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-13-00032 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-514-TO-16-00009,,8/1/2018 0:00,,Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Gender equity ~|~_©_~|~ Institutional sustainability ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Violence against women ~|~_©_~|~ Women ~|~_©_~|~ Youth,Colombia,AID-OAA-I-13-00032 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-514-TO-16-00009,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T91M.pdf,2101 KB,"003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

PA-00T-8WG,"Kosovo faces one of its most pressing development challenges in articulating a coherent and enforceable set of property rights, which are structurally vital to any countrys legal, political and economic development. The USAID/Kosovo Property Rights Program (PRP) sought to improve the property rights regime in Kosovo, strengthen rule of law (RoL), and increase economic growth and investment. PRP has been instrumental in developing the National Property Rights Strategy for Kosovo, expanding the understanding of womens rights to property through a popular outreach campaign, increasing efficiency in courts focusing on property rights cases, and ensuring that even the most remote municipalities have staff and institutions working toward enhancing citizens (and especially womens) rights to inherit and register property. Even though Kosovo has made notable progress, led by PRP, in its property rights regime, it continues to face major challenges. Specifically, Kosovo has yet to define the different forms of public property, mindsetsmost notably among menabout womens property rights continue to impede equal access to property rights, and education at law faculties as well as in the primary and secondary school systems does not focus on gender or gender equality under the law. Even though the Government of Kosovo, supported by USAID and PRP, has passed legislation to positively impact property rights, there is still limited political and judicial capacity to enforce it.",Footer title: Kosovo property rights program midterm performance evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order title: Property rights program (PRP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Regional program support for Balkan countries,Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-167-I-17-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ 72016718F00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-167-TO-14-00006 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-12-00032,,4/1/2018 0:00,,Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Gender equality ~|~_©_~|~ Judges ~|~_©_~|~ Judicial reform ~|~_©_~|~ Litigation ~|~_©_~|~ Violence against women ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Kosovo,AID-167-TO-14-00006 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-12-00032,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T8WG.pdf,933 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,010393 - USAID.

PA-00T-8WD,"This report is a mid-term performance evaluation (PE) of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/Burma Private Sector Development Activity (PSDA), a $23 million five-year project designed to 1) create more inclusive and transparent economic governance rules and processes and 2) increase access to finance for emerging economic actors. PSDA began operations in mid-2015 and is being implemented by Nathan Associates. Beneficiaries of the activity include civil society organizations (CSOs), microfinance institutions (MFI), associations, entrepreneurs, private sector actors, and the Government and people of Myanmar. USAID designed PSDA to be an economic policy reform and institution-building operation with an emphasis on promoting evidence-based, public-private policy dialogue. At the same time, the Activity delivers specific, rapid-response technical assistance (TA) to foster important and evolving policy and legislative reforms. This report answers the following evaluation questions: <br /><br />1. Which approaches to catalyze economic reforms have been most effective and least effective, based on progress achieved toward intended results? 1a: Which factors influenced the achievement or non-achievement of intended results? <br />2. To what extent have the approaches to capacity building of the public/private sector made progress toward intended results? <br />3. To what extent have the grants contributed to increasing broad-based economic opportunities? <br />4. Which approaches to achieve the objective of improving financial services have been most effective and least effective, based on progress achieved toward intended results? <br /><br />The methods used in this qualitative PE consist of document review, key informant interviews (KII), and focus group discussions (FGDs). <br /><br />Overall, PSDA is a well-managed Activity operating in a complex environment. After two and a half years of intensive work in a slow-moving and opaque policy reform context, PSDA has achieved concrete policy reform success in access to finance, which has led to an increase in broad based economic opportunities, primarily for women. PSDA has also succeeded in improving the capacity of a variety of CSOs to engage in policy dialogue with relevant Government of Myanmar (GOM) ministries. It is recommended that PSDA capitalize on current momentum in a focused number of issue areas for the remainder of the Activity by leveraging key relationships with comm",Footer title: USAID PSDA mid-term evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order title: Private sector development activity (PSDA) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: USAID Asia learning and M&E support also known as Asia learning and monitoring and evaluation (ALME),Special Evaluation,Documents,72048218F00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-486-I-14-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-482-C-15-00001,,8/1/2018 0:00,,Agricultural technology ~|~_©_~|~ Business enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Economic policy ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Microfinance ~|~_©_~|~ Policy reform ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Burma,AID-482-C-15-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T8WD.pdf,1988 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008521 - USAID.

PA-00T-89P,"<p class=""p1"">The USAID-funded Linkages Across the Continuum of HIV Services for Key Populations Affected by HIV (LINKAGES) project, implemented in 30 countries, aims to increase the availability of and demand for HIV services for key populations and strengthen national government and civil society capacity to deliver these services. The objectives of the mid-term evaluation were to: assess project effectiveness, planning, management, service delivery, and sustainability; identify constraints to implementation; and propose recommendations for improvements. Methods included review of project documents and data, key informant interviews, and country visits.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class=""p2"">All project countries have increased key population numbers being reached, being tested for HIV, and initiating treatment. This is a considerable achievement in a relatively short time and in contexts with significant policy, systems, and structural challenges. LINKAGES is making an important contribution to national responses for key populations by raising government awareness, supporting the provision of essential HIV services, and building the capacity of local implementing partners. LINKAGES is also introducing innovative approaches and identifying promising practices with the potential to engage harder to reach groups, increase HIV testing uptake and yield, and improve treatment uptake and retention. However, achieving some targets has been a challenge, and losses to follow-up occur at multiple points in the HIV cascade. Key lessons include the importance of demonstrating proof of concept to justify national scale-up, ensuring planning is informed by sound situation analysis and data, adapting approaches to local and hyperlocal contexts, strong collaboration with public sector providers of clinical services, sustaining capacity development for organizations providing services to key populations, and strengthening structural interventions<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p>",Evaluated task order title: The linkages across the continuum of HIV services for key populations affected by HIV (LINKAGES) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health program cycle improvement project (GH Pro),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,,7/1/2018 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Discrimination ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Health care costs ~|~_©_~|~ Learning readiness ~|~_©_~|~ Violence against women,Thailand ~|~_©_~|~ Malawi ~|~_©_~|~ Africa south of Sahara,AID-OAA-A-14-00045,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T89P.pdf,3466 KB,040668 - Dexis Consulting Group,,010929 - USAID.

PA-00T-881,"The purpose of the final performance evaluation of the Higher Education for Economic Growth Activity (HEA) is to provide recommendations to: 1) the Activity for the final year; and 2) the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) for future programming. The evaluation focused on five evaluation questions (EQs), including: assessing results (EQ 1); the role of clusters (EQ 2); the government and higher education institutions (EQ 3); gender (EQ 4); and analyzing the extent to which results will be sustained (EQ 5). The evaluation used a mixed-methods approach, including document review; analysis of HEAs monitoring and evaluation data and performance indicators; key informant interviews and surveys for faculty/staff; focus group discussions; and direct observation. Key illustrative findings include: 1) teachers consider diploma programs available, high quality, and wellfacilitated; 2) trust has been established via positive and significant effects from collaboration; 3) while there has been an established approach to construct a higher education policy, the approach needs to be broader in terms of participants (including the government); 4) there is improved access to science, technology, engineering, and math for women and girls; and 5) the Centers for Career Development, which promote student engagement with the private sector, are the most likely to sustain. The evaluation recommends that USAID continue to support the investigations, curriculum reform implementation, teacher training, and scholarships, as well initiate as the construction of an entity to strategically integrate and give continuity to the cluster model.",Evaluated project title: Higher education for economic growth,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-I-15-00024 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-519-TO-16-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-519-C-14-00004,,5/1/2018 0:00,,Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Gender equality ~|~_©_~|~ Higher education ~|~_©_~|~ Learning readiness ~|~_©_~|~ Life skills ~|~_©_~|~ Manufacturing ~|~_©_~|~ Mathematics,El Salvador,AID-519-C-14-00004,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T881.pdf,1283 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates,,008540 - USAID.

(SI) to conduct a mid-term performance evaluation of the <em>Colombia Transforma </em>program (2015-2019), which aims to increase the Colombian governments ability to plan and execute rapid response elements of the Peace Accord and to promote collaboration between territorial actors in support of the Accords implementation. The evaluation assessed the programs strategic approach, relevance, and contributions, while offering suggestions to improve its implementation and inform United States Government (USG) assistance in Colombia. The evaluation was conducted by a three-person team between January and April 2018. The evaluation concluded that while the program has focused appropriately on rapid response activities relevant to the Peace Accords success, its performance is slowing down due to the volume of activities and other constraints. The program has been more effective in improving the presence of Colombian government entities created for the post-conflict period, and some local entities, than that of the national government as a whole. It has promoted collaboration among local actors, particularly through small infrastructure activities and resources otherwise unavailable. The program, however, faces challenges due to a changing political environment, concerns about the viability of Peace Accord implementation, interpretation of some USG counter-terrorism statutes, and operational considerations. The evaluation offers recommendations to improve the programs performance<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p>",Evaluated task order title: Colombia transforma ~|~_©_~|~ Spanish ed.: PB-AAJ-696,Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-TO-15-00012 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-13-00006,,5/1/2018 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Dance ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Journalism ~|~_©_~|~ Local level ~|~_©_~|~ Rural areas ~|~_©_~|~ Violence against women,Colombia,AID-OAA-TO-15-00012 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-13-00006,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T7WK.pdf,1541 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,"010972 - USAID.

PA-00T-7DD,"<div>This performance evaluation assesses progress in the five-year, $70 million Supporting Operational AIDS Research (SOAR) Project. The report addresses the following evaluation questions: What types of research are being conducted by the Project? How timely have they been? What are the key best practices from the implementation phase? What is the effectiveness of the Research Utilization strategy of the Project and how well has this strategy been implemented? How effective has the Project been at sharing data from studies (both interim and final data) and setting up structures or opportunities to promote and disseminate findings? How relevant and how well aligned are SOARs research activities to the U.S. Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and USAIDs Office of HIV and AIDS stated priorities, and Mission needs (as of 2017)? and Are there areas that need to be re-aligned?</div> <div>The report summarizes achievements to date in each of the projects three intended results: high-quality operations research and evaluations to advance HIV and AIDS program implementation, strengthened capacity to conduct high-quality operations research and evaluation among local institutions, and dissemination and utilization results from operations research and evaluations. Although most research activities were not yet complete when the evaluation was conducted, experience and lessons learned from implementation to date yielded valuable best practices for AIDS-related operations research. The evaluation found variations within operational environments that affect definitions of timeliness for obtaining data or findings from research efforts and makes recommendations for implementation during the remainder of the project within a changed funding environment.</div>","""Midterm evaluation assignment number 478"" ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order title: Supporting operational AIDS research (SOAR) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health program cycle improvement (GH pro)",Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-A-14-00060,,6/1/2018 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Operations research ~|~_©_~|~ Research utilization ~|~_©_~|~ Time,Africa,AID-OAA-A-14-00060,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T7DD.pdf,1960 KB,040668 - Dexis Consulting Group ~|~_©_~|~ 000974 - Population Council,,010929 - USAID.

PA-00T-6QS,"<div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">USAIDs Center of Excellence for Democracy, Human Rights and Governance contracted Social Impact, Inc. to conduct an impact evaluation of USAIDs Ghana Strengthening Accountability Mechanisms (GSAM) program, which aims to increase accountability of local District Assemblies in Ghana. This impact evaluation, a randomized-controlled trial, tests the effect of two distinct efforts to increase accountability and improve service delivery outcomes at the district level. One hundred fifty of Ghanas districts were matched and randomized into one of three groups: a top-down treatment group that received performance audits conducted by the central government Ghana Audit Service (GAS); a bottom-up treatment group that received civil-society organization (CSO) led scorecard campaigns; and a control group that did not receive either intervention.</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">Through surveys with citizens, local administrators, and local politicians and through a review of administrative data, we find that both CSO and GAS programming have had some important impacts, even as some features of district governance are difficult to change. Across both GAS and CSO programming, GSAM reduces citizen satisfaction with projects and services, a finding largely driven by the districts that receive negative audit reports. This indicates that citizens are correctly attributing bad audit performance to poor-performing District Assemblies. CSO and GAS programming have different effects. GSAMs bottom-up, citizen-focused, CSO programming has generally had more effect on citizen engagement and the behavior of administrators than top-down GAS programming. At the same time, the top-down GAS programming has had a bigger effect on politicians, who are sensitive to incentives created by centralized party and budget systems, and who have decreased political manipulation of the budget as a result of the intervention. Despite these improvements, there are a number of areas of district project and budget management, including development project completion, that were unaffected by the interventions.</span></div>","Task order title: Democracy, human rights & governance - learning, evaluation, and research (DRG-LER) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Ghana strengthening accountability mechanisms (GSAM)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-M-13-00011 ~|~_©_~|~ GS-10F-0294V ~|~_©_~|~ AID-641-A-15-00002,,4/1/2018 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Anticorruption interventions ~|~_©_~|~ Development projects ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Households ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Rule of law ~|~_©_~|~ Transparency,Ghana,AID-641-A-15-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T6QS.pdf,1846 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc. ~|~_©_~|~ 010850 - CARE USA",,"040194 - USAID.

Qualitative evaluation methodologies, involving ninety-four key informant interviews, twenty focus group discussions, and eight field observations, were used to supplement documentary data. The evaluations principal conclusions are: (1) FIFES has become more of an agricultural extension activity than the community forestry activity originally intended; (2) community forests should be used to finance forest management and protection and improve the welfare of their populations by sustainably producing and selling commercial forest products and services; (3) community forests can effectively protect biodiversity by protecting key habitats for endangered species and ecosystems, implementing best forestry practices and supplying market demand for forest products; (4) the involvement of women and youth in decision-making processes and financial management is necessary for community forests to become successful and sustainable. The principal recommendation is to refocus FIFES on creating model community forests that are linked to Liberias overall forestry sector, thereby helping it to improve.</span>",Evaluated task order  title: Forest incomes for environmental sustainability (FIFES) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Liberia strategic analysis (LSA),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-669-C-16-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-669-A-16-00002,,6/1/2018 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Business enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Forestry ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Income ~|~_©_~|~ Logging ~|~_©_~|~ Youth,Liberia,AID-669-A-16-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T5TC.pdf,1268 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc. ~|~_©_~|~ 010380 - ACDI/VOCA",,008570 - USAID.

PA-00T-5QN,"<span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">The purpose of the performance evaluation of the Genomics to Improve Poultry - Innovation Lab (GIP-IL) is to provide evidence that USAID's Bureau for Food Security can use to inform expanded investments in animal genomics research, improve effectiveness of existing programs, and better achieve outcomes. GIP-ILs aim is improving poultry production among African small farmers through advanced genomic approaches that enhance chickens innate resistance to Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) and heat stress. The GIP-IL was awarded to the University of California at Davis in 2013 with an end date of September 2018. This evaluation covered the period April 2013 - April 2017. The Evaluation Team (ET) used mixed methods to assess the project's progress, its success building host country capacity, and its effectiveness in fostering collaborations. The ET also evaluated project management and prospects for the project's future. Quantitative and qualitative methods included document reviews, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, site visits, and an online survey. The evaluation concluded that the project has had partial success achieving its research objectives and has produced high-quality research. It has successfully built capacity by training researchers and students; and has had success achieving sustainable collaborations with academics and, to a lesser extent, with government, civil society, and private sector partners. The project has also successfully engaged women. Technical and research aspects are managed well, but logistical and other constraints remain. Therefore, the project would benefit from additional funding for an extension to complete research, validate, and distribute poultry among small farmers.</span>",Evaluated task order title:  Innovation lab for genomics to improve poultry (GIP-IL) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Program evaluation for effectiveness and learning (PEEL),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-I-15-00024 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-TO-16-00008 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-A-13-00080,,4/1/2018 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Chickens ~|~_©_~|~ Food production ~|~_©_~|~ Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Genetics ~|~_©_~|~ Learning readiness ~|~_©_~|~ Poultry ~|~_©_~|~ Students,Tanzania ~|~_©_~|~ Ghana,AID-OAA-A-13-00080,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T5QN.pdf,2387 KB,"008414 - Mendez England and Associates ~|~_©_~|~ 001222 - University of California, Davis",,013469 - USAID.

The Vriddhi project provided technical and managerial assistance to the state and national governments of India focusing on improving quality of RMNCH+A services within healthcare facilities. This evaluation examined the projects performance and effectiveness and provide insights and lessons learned to inform USAID/Indias future RMNCH+A programming. The evaluation collected data through an exhaustive document review, analysis of secondary quantitative data, and 88 key informant interviews with 114 total respondents. Among the many project components, the project dedicated the largest share of its time and resources to improving the quality of care during the intra-partum and immediate post-partum period. The Care around Birth approach was designed to reduce preventable maternal and infant mortality and effectively built the capacity of health providers to deliver high-impact obstetric and newborn interventions. However, the project faced numerous challenges, including perennial deficiencies in human resources and infrastructure, which limited its overall impact. The projects supply-side mandate and its primary focus on maternal health also limited its scope and resulted in missed opportunities for demand generation and an inability to address issues of access to healthcare services. This evaluation report also provides recommendations to USAID and implementing partners for the remainder of the project and future work in the RMNCH+A sector.</span>","Evaluated project title: Vriddhi also known as scaling up interventions in reproductive, maternal, neonatal, child, and adolescent health (RMNCH+A)",Special Evaluation,Documents,72038618F00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-486-I-14-00001,,6/1/2018 0:00,,Quality of care ~|~_©_~|~ Maternal child health care ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Reproductive health ~|~_©_~|~ Obstetrics ~|~_©_~|~ Preventive health care,India,72038618F00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-486-I-14-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T556.pdf,869 KB,"Social Impact, Inc.",,USAID/India,English,application/pdf,,,"Jayakumar, Beulah ~|~_©_~|~ Feenstra, Meredith ~|~_©_~|~ Ghoston, Leah ~|~_©_~|~ Raj, Francis",Maternal child health care,Jun-18,,,,Evaluation report : USAID/India Vriddhi : scaling up interventions in RMNCH+A mid-term performance evaluation,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=NTA4MTQ5,India,,,2018-06-01,2018,IND,IND_2018,0.5789687754530711,0.773860226889698,0.605015673981191,0.22077587477166696,0.329381263119288,,0.6308211132583079,0.426546930410326,0.5855386146520319,0.24920254484979198,0.448354143019296,0.586716398326081,,0.447098581388035,0.55293813098628,,0.5912408759124089,IND,2018,1.0,0.49649903307813403,2.0,0.5059331185685837,AZE_2015,AZE_2014,VNM_2013,HND_2018,AZE_2013

The project has two intermediate resultsimproved agricultural productivity and increased market access and tradeand focuses on five value chains: coffee, soybean, ginger, sesame, and melon. The purpose of the VC-RDs evaluation was to assess its progress towards intended goals and objectives, successes and challenges, its exit strategy, as well as to provide recommendations to improve the activity and ensure that intended goals and objectives are met by the end of the activity. To conduct the evaluation, the evaluation team (ET) used a mixed-methods approach, which included: document review, 36 focus group discussions, 86 key informant interviews, and storytelling. Findings show VC-RD has improved gross margins of farmers in the sesame and melon value chains through better input management, and in the specialty coffee value chain by enhancing production and processing quality and creating market linkages. Challenges include long payment timelines (coffee), limited increase in gross margin (soybean, ginger), reliance on a few market players (coffee, soybean), limited options for market linkages (melon, sesame, ginger) for products of improved quality that meet Good Agricultural Practices criteria, and limited adaptation of training (soybean, ginger). The ET recommends VC-RD focus on adaptation of training, more effective integration of gender and nutrition, strengthening of producer organizations to enable scaling-up and sustainability, and widening of linkages across a range of market players in all five value chains.</span>",Evaluated task order title: Value chains for rural development (VC-RD) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Program evaluation for effectiveness and learning (PEEL),Special Evaluation,Documents,AID-OAA-TO-16-00008 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-15-00024 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-482-LA-14-00004 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-L-13-00006,,5/1/2018 0:00,,Value chains ~|~_©_~|~ Rural development ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural production ~|~_©_~|~ Coffee ~|~_©_~|~ Soybeans ~|~_©_~|~ Ginger ~|~_©_~|~ Sesame ~|~_©_~|~ Fruit ~|~_©_~|~ Farmers ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural markets ~|~_©_~|~ Quality control ~|~_©_~|~ Nutrition,Burma,AID-482-LA-14-00004,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T52C.pdf,1852 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates ~|~_©_~|~ 001798 - Winrock International,,013469 - USAID.

This process was part of a broader effort to devolve administrative, fiscal, and legal powers to local and provincial entities in Iraq and to provide local service delivery to a broader section of society through a decentralized governance model in accordance with the law. Through enhanced efficiency in delivering provincial government-based services, the project assumed that this would lead to increased government responsiveness to community needs and citizen participation in decision-making, which ultimately would garner the state heightened legitimacy and stability. This evaluation sought to delineate the failures and successes of the project with a keen awareness of the complexities in post-conflict Iraqi society and the various stakeholders and beneficiaries, namely women, the elderly, ethnic minorities and other vulnerable groups. Overall, the Taqadum effort has achieved success in supporting a partial devolution of power through training and support for development mapping and planning processes from ministries to directorates and for service delivery improvement planning and implementation at the provincial levels. Despite these successes, legal and fiscal decentralization are largely incomplete and citizen perception of both GOI and local service delivery remains low.

PA-00S-W4K,"<span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">The Innovation Lab for Small Scale Irrigation (ILSSI) is a research project funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/Bureau for Food Security (BFS). ILSSI aims to contribute to Feed the Futures overarching goal of sustainably reducing global poverty and hunger through transforming key production systems and enhancing nutrition and food security through small scale irrigation (SSI). This external performance evaluation assessed ILSSIs achievements and provides empirical evidence supporting learning and improvement for BFS Feed the Future work. The evaluation team (ET) used mixed-methods and multiple sources of evidence, including document review, observations, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and field visits to Ethiopia and Ghana. The ET found that ILSSI is well managed, despite being a complex project with activities across three countries. The project provided capacity building on high-demand Integrated Decision Support System and associated models to universities, research institutes, and government entities. Farmers indicated that the new technologies and practices ILSSI introduced have potential to increase yields, incomes, and living standards. The research is high quality but several economic and social-behavioral issues, including access to equipment and supply chains, unwillingness to pay for equipment, and sparse ground support, constrain scaling up. Partners recognize these issues but note the importance of understanding and addressing them before scaling up SSI. To facilitate scaling-up, the evaluation recommends a second ILSSI phase that incorporates entrepreneurial and practical solutions for research, covers environmental and economic conditions, and focuses on market solutions and scaling innovations, while continuing to generate knowledge.</span>",Evaluated project title: Innovation lab for small scale irrigation (ILSSI) ~|~_©_~|~ Task order title: Feed the future program evaluation for effectiveness and learning (PEEL),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-TO-16-00008 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-15-00024,,3/1/2018 0:00,,Agricultural production ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural technology ~|~_©_~|~ Farmers ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Food production ~|~_©_~|~ Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Irrigation ~|~_©_~|~ Small farms ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural equipment ~|~_©_~|~ Equipment costs ~|~_©_~|~ Local capacity building ~|~_©_~|~ Crop quality,Africa south of Sahara ~|~_©_~|~ Ghana ~|~_©_~|~ Ethiopia,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00SW4K.pdf,1262 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates,,013469 - USAID.

PA-00S-WXH,"<span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">The Soybean Innovation Lab (SIL) is a 5-year, $10 million Research-for-Development (R4D) project, managed by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (2013-2018). SIL researches factors limiting adoption and sustainability of soybean production, processing, and consumption in sub-Saharan Africa. The research results are translated to key stakeholders, including development practitioners, the private sector, and government agencies. The evaluation of SIL focuses on program management; the research and training program; institutional collaboration; and the programs future. In visits to Urbana-Champaign, Ghana, and Ethiopia, the evaluation team collected qualitative and quantitative data through 1) program document review; 2) 59 key informant interviews; 3) group discussions with Principal Investigators; 4) direct observation of two key program-related events; 5) case studies of selected R4D products; and 6) an online survey of 35 SIL staff and partners. SILs R4D products are largely appropriate, but dissemination should be part of the research process and guided by articulation of development pathways for R4D products. The evaluation found that SILs wide range of partnerships has successfully developed institutional capacity, but more networking and linkage activitiesby both SIL and USAIDare recommended. SILs current investments in technical research areas should continue, with particular attention paid to practical ways research is undertaken to ensure technology uptake. Gaps in market linkages for input and output value chains need to be identified and addressed. In the future, extension support to development partners and feedback loops on the uptake and use of SILs R4D products and associated outputs will also be needed.</span>",Evaluated project title: Research-for-development (R4D) ~|~_©_~|~ Task order title: Feed the future program evaluation for effectiveness and learning (PEEL),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-TO- 16-00008 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-15-00024,,3/1/2018 0:00,,Agricultural innovations ~|~_©_~|~ Value chains ~|~_©_~|~ Soybeans ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural research ~|~_©_~|~ Crop production ~|~_©_~|~ Networks ~|~_©_~|~ Input output analysis ~|~_©_~|~ Gender integration ~|~_©_~|~ Human nutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Farms,Africa south of Sahara,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00SWXH.pdf,2617 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates,,013469 - USAID.

PA-00T-2V9,"<span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">The ""Mitigating Xenophobic Violence"" (MXV) activity was a 23 month (January 2016-November 2017), $4.2 million activity to identify local conflict drivers and improve accountability for government social service delivery to mitigate the outbreak of violence.&nbsp; It was supported by USAID Southern Africa (USAID/SA) with Complex Crisis Fund (CCF) funding and implemented by Freedom House.&nbsp; It worked in 16 hotspot communities, selected based on their history of and continued potential for the outbreak of xenophobic violence.&nbsp; In December 2017, USAID/SA commissioned Democracy International (DI) to conduct an end-of-project performance evaluation of the activity.&nbsp; The evaluation utilized a mixed methods approach comprised of several rapid appraisal techniques, including: desk review and secondary data mining, key stakeholder and small group interviews, roundtable discussions, and a brief electronic survey.&nbsp; The primary audience of the evaluation was USAID/Southern Africa, USAID/Washington, CCF managers, Freedom House.&nbsp; Secondary audiences include other practitioners and scholars working on combating xenophobic violence.&nbsp; Overall, the Activity made a number of notable achievements on challenging issues with limited resources and timeframe.&nbsp; It completed 16 in-depth community conflict assessments, which were then used to design subsequent activities.&nbsp; This included establishing and developing capacity of Peacebuilding Teams (PBTs), developing community action plans, forming civic education circles, and providing service delivery monitoring training.&nbsp; However, while changes in behaviors and attitudes could be seen at individual levels, the evaluation struggled to identify community-wide results given the lack of baseline data, as well as the activitys limited timeframe and financial resources.&nbsp; The activity also struggled to identify explicit linkages between gender and xenophobic violence, despite an extensive effort to do so.&nbsp; While the sustainability of the PBTs looks promising given the personal commitment and dedication of the PBT members and the strong level of community support for their work, other aspects of the program, such as the service delivery and civic education training, look less likely to continue without additional outside support.&nbsp; (Author abstract)</span>",Evaluated project title: Mitigating xenophobic violence (MXV),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,72067418F00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-15-00017,,5/1/2018 0:00,,Violence ~|~_©_~|~ Racial discrimination ~|~_©_~|~ Conflict prevention ~|~_©_~|~ Conflict resolution ~|~_©_~|~ Alternative dispute resolution ~|~_©_~|~ Social services ~|~_©_~|~ Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Access to justice,South Africa,674-A-00-10-00117-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-674-A-00-10-00117,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T2V9.pdf,4319 KB,"012295 - Democracy International, Inc.",,"008605 - USAID.

PA-00S-VGX,"Purpose: The midterm performance evaluation of MEASURE Evaluation Phase IV seeks to inform technical programming and program management activities.&nbsp; Questions: The evaluation responds to three overarching questions: (1) Is the project meeting its stakeholders' needs? (2) What are the benefits of a health sectorwide versus a health areaspecific approach? (3) Are the tools developed useful? Methods: This evaluation used a mixed-methods approach.&nbsp; The team conducted in-person interviews with 117 stakeholders in Cote d'Ivoire, Mali, and Nigeria; 49 virtual or in-person interviews with internal and external stakeholders in Washington, D.C., and other countries; an online survey with 120 internal (U.S. Government) and external stakeholders; and a review of 104 project documents.&nbsp; Findings and Conclusions: MEASURE Evaluation has been successful in meeting many needs at country and global levels, but has been challenged to comprehensively and consistently meet all needs.&nbsp; Stakeholders perceive a unique role for the project in the USAID landscape in strengthening heath information systems (HIS), conducting health impact evaluations, and building evaluation capacity.&nbsp; They view the project's approach to technical assistance and capacity building as facilitating ownership and sustainability at the country level.&nbsp; Almost all stakeholders see the benefits of a health sectorwide approach to strengthening HIS; however, this is challenging for USAID, given the funding streams it has to manage.&nbsp; Stakeholders appreciate and use the many tools that the project has developed and adapted.&nbsp; Strengthening data quality and data use for decision making and facilitating interoperability of databases remain the most pressing HIS strengthening needs.

PA-00S-V5J,"The USAID-funded Tax Policy and Administration Reform (TPAR) and Fiscal Policy and Expenditure Management (FPEMP) programs sought to strengthen fiscal administration processes and supporting information technology (IT) systems in El Salvador in order to contribute to a modern fiscal policy management system and increased tax collections.&nbsp; The TPAR and FPEMP performance evaluation examined the extent to which they individually and jointly contributed to achieving these objectives and the likely sustainability of their achievements.&nbsp; The evaluation also examined questions related to how external factors contributed to program achievements and the program's coordination with other donor organizations.&nbsp; The evaluation concludes that TPAR and FPEMP made strong contributions to improving fiscal policy management processes and supporting IT systems within the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and its several Directorates, which in turn have both directly and indirectly contributed to increased tax collections in the country via increased voluntary compliance, increased collection of tax arrears, and reduced tax evasion.&nbsp; The administrative and IT reforms enacted with program support are, for the most part, in the process of being institutionalized within the MOF Directorates, implying good prospects for long-term sustainability once USAID's assistance has ended.&nbsp; TPAR and FPEMP also contributed to strengthening MOF's technical capacity, improving fiscal transparency, and engaging the private and public sectors for the purpose of fiscal policy legal reform.&nbsp; In doing so, the programs benefited in many cases from incremental to substantive contributions from other donor organizations and MOF's own initiative, and ongoing support from the Government of El Salvador (GOES) and MOF.&nbsp; (Author abstract, modified)",Evaluated task order title: Tax policy and administration reform (TPAR) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Fiscal policy and expenditure management (FPEMP) ~|~_©_~|~ Spanish ed.:PA-00S-XFF,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-519-TO-16-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-15-00024,,12/1/2017 0:00,,Fiscal policy ~|~_©_~|~ Taxation ~|~_©_~|~ Tax collection ~|~_©_~|~ Tax evasion ~|~_©_~|~ Transparency ~|~_©_~|~ Legal reform ~|~_©_~|~ Donor coordination ~|~_©_~|~ Sustainable development,El Salvador,GEG-I-05-04-00001-00 ~|~_©_~|~ GEG-I-00-04-00001-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GEG-I-05-04-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GEG-I-00-04-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-519-C-11-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00SV5J.pdf,1177 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates,,"008540 - USAID.

PA-00S-RRZ,"USAID/Madagascar Mikolo Project supports Madagascar's national policy for the implementation of community-based service delivery, to increase access to and availability of community-based primary health care, especially for women of reproductive age, children under age five, and infants living in remote areas of Madagascar.&nbsp; This evaluation of the Mikolo Project is to: (1) to learn to what extent the project's goals and objectives have been achieved; and (2) to inform the design of a future community-based health services activity.&nbsp; The evaluation explored if Mikolo will achieve its objectives, how it improved the Government of Madagascar's use of data for decision-making, and how effective is Mikolo's management structure.&nbsp; This evaluation utilized qualitative methods (i.e., document review, key informant interviews, focus group discussions and observations), supplemented by a review of existing quantitative data (e.g., project data and Community Health Volunteer (CHV) monthly report data).&nbsp; Working closely with the Madagascar Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), Mikolo has been successful in achieving most of its targeted outcomes in support of community health service delivery.&nbsp; Areas for improvement include training, support, and supervision for CHVs; community engagement for demand creation and healthy practices; and referral systems.&nbsp; Working with local NGOs and MOPH, data quality has improved, but more work is needed to improve the use of these data.&nbsp; (Author abstract)",Evaluation assignment number 383 ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Mikolo ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health program cycle improvement (GH pro),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,,12/1/2017 0:00,,Communes ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Health care costs ~|~_©_~|~ Households ~|~_©_~|~ Sports ~|~_©_~|~ USAID ~|~_©_~|~ Youth,Madagascar,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00SRRZ.pdf,3093 KB,040668 - Dexis Consulting Group,,008572 - USAID.
