PA-00K-C41,"The Timor-Leste Fostering Transparency Initiative's (FOTI) program worked to reduce corruption and emphasized building human and institutional capacity. FOTI was divided into six major components: (1) Anti-Corruption Commission (CAC); (2) Office of the Prosecutor General (OPG); (3) internal and external audit; (4) procurement; (5) national parliament; and (6) external watchdog and public advocacy. The primary intended purpose of this evaluation is to (1) provide lessons learned for Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste (RDTL), USAID, and other stakeholders in implementing future anti-corruption (AC) activities; (2) uphold MCC's commitment to maintaining accountability and measuring program results; and (3) provide practical lessons for current and future Threshold partners. Slight modifications to the program logic were permitted through a contract modification of the scope of work (SOW) shortly before the end of the program in December 2013. These were primarily to match the required activities to the altered contextual realities. The primary evaluation topics identified were: (1) program logic; (2) activities designed and implemented; (3) influence on changes in knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors; and (4) sustainability &amp; lessons learned. The program was -- at least in the case of corruption survey -- able to take corrective actions that made it more responsive to the target institution's priorities. If the program had a better sense of the needs and desires of the target organizations, it seems likely that the activities would have launched more quickly and decreased the likelihood of needing to substantially modify the SOW. Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each of the evaluation topics.

PA-00K-43J,"The Property Rights and Resource Governance (PRRG) program was designed to create opportunities for missions to obtain technical assistance on property rights assessments and other activities.&nbsp; Its primary objectives were to: (1) expand on the Office of Land Tenure and Property Rights (LTPR) framework and refine existing and develop new companion tools to augment the framework; (2) provide training and educational tools related to property rights; (3) develop improved knowledge management and information distribution systems; and (4) continue to provide technical assistance to missions and operating units to address property rights and develop programs supporting their operational plans.&nbsp; The evaluation encompassed all five PRRG components: (1) training (Components 1-2); (2) tools (Component 3); (3) knowledge management (Component 4); and (4) mission and operating unit buy-ins (Component 5). USAID's Office of Land Tenure and Resource Management posed ten questions, which directed the evaluation: (1) was there a change in the legal, regulatory or project framework at the project site; (2) has access to land governance institutions changed; (3) how have beneficiaries' knowledge and attitudes about land rights and tenure security changed; (4) how have power dynamics relating to land and gender changed; (5) has the project impacted beneficiary income, nutrition, and health; (6) are there any gender related differences in the achieved impacts; (7)&nbsp; what role did project design (and any changes/evolution in the design or its management) play in the program's final results; (8) what are the key determinants of success in documenting and disseminating the results of successful natural resources management (NRM) tools for greater adoption in the land tenure and property rights arena; (9) how widespread and available are resources on land tenure and land-based conflict resolution; and (10) did PRRG contribute to the field through increased knowledge?&nbsp; By all accounts, the vision of PRRG was realized.&nbsp; PRRG helped USAID clarify and encourage a progressive agenda through strengthened training programs and refinement and enlargement of the LTPR matrix and framework.&nbsp; PRRG opened the conversation on property rights to larger and larger audiences.&nbsp; The program promoted a common language and provided people with fundamental information through knowledge management products and activities and training.&nbsp; PRRG gave practitioners the opportunity to test ideas on property rights in dynamic environments, and it created new space for collecting and sharing those experiences.&nbsp; Where PRRG's results fell short of possibilities, most of those shortcomings were related to the program's unanticipated popularity or resulted from the program's pace and willingness to take chances.&nbsp; Only one major lesson from the experience leading up to PRRG -- the need to encourage the design of programs for gender equity -- appears to be a significant opportunity missed.&nbsp; Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question.

PA-00K-3Q6,"The Development Grants Program (DGP) is a competitive small grants program, established in 2008 that provides targeted support to U.S. private voluntary organizations (PVOs) and local non-government organizations (NGOs) that have limited or no experience in managing direct USAID grants. &nbsp;Successful PVO/NGO applicants receive awards (usually up to $2 millon) to implement activities in the field over a period of up to five years. &nbsp;Awards include a capacity development component providing awardees with access to resources for technical assistance and/or organizational strengthening. &nbsp;The purpose of this evaluation is to determine whether USAID and the DGP-funded projects have improved the capacity of communities to cope with climate change and advance environmental innovation and, at the same time, built the technical and institutional capacity of the partner implementing national NGOs and the private voluntary organizations (PVO)? &nbsp; The evaluation addresses the following 7 key questions examining USAID's support to its partners and the results of these projects: (1) to what extent has the program/project been successful in achieving results for its stated technical objective [and] what have been the key drivers of and limitations on performance to date; (2) how is the work of the implementing organization perceived and valued by beneficiaries; (3) to what extent has the partnership with USAID strengthened or otherwise changed the capacity (organizational, financial, technical etc.) of the implementing partner; (4) to what extent has USAID's approach supported the local organization in meeting its priorities, which may have changed over time; (5) what, if any, challenges has the implementing partner faced in meeting USAID program requirements; (6) what is the likelihood that the interventions (organizational development, technical results etc.) supported by USAID will be sustainable over the long term [and] how could the interventions have been improved to increase their long-term sustainability; and (7) what are the key strategic, programmatic, technical and managerial lessons learned that should be taken into account in similar future initiatives in the region/worldwide? &nbsp;A summary of findings states that at a programmatic level, USAID/Southern Africa's implementation of the DGP has worked well. &nbsp;The implementation modality through local NGOs has been successful and efficient and the technical and institutional capacity of the partner NGOs has been significantly enhanced. &nbsp;It is however the opinion of the evaluation team and personnel from the implementing partners that the program would have benefited from increased coordination between the different projects. &nbsp;The key findings and primary conclusions for the USAID DGP are summarized for each key result area in the evaluation report. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",No cover title ~|~_©_~|~ 'RFTOP- SOL- 674-14-000009' ~|~_©_~|~ Also known as: USAID development grants program Southern Africa phase I : performance evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Enhanced water supply and sanitation in Swaziland ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Climate change adaptation in the Lesotho highlands ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Reef rescuers ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Stepping up to sustainability,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,,,7/1/2014 0:00,,Climate change ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Gardening ~|~_©_~|~ Institutional sustainability ~|~_©_~|~ Jewelry ~|~_©_~|~ Reefs ~|~_©_~|~ Water sanitation ~|~_©_~|~ Weather,Swaziland ~|~_©_~|~ Lesotho ~|~_©_~|~ Seychelles ~|~_©_~|~ Southern Africa,674-A-00-10-00105-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 674-A-00-10-00124-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 674-A-00-10-00123-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 674-A-00-11-00015-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00K3Q6.pdf,1051 KB,040847 - DNA Economics,,012599 - USAID.

PA-00K-33P,"<p>Health Program of the Community Livelihoods Project (CLP) in Yemen is an integrated, multi-sectoral, assistance project designed to mitigate the instability in some of Yemen's most difficult regions through the facilitation and implementation of quality government service delivery, job creation, responsive local governance, and active civic participation.&nbsp; Within the CLP the health program has focused largely on the extension of reproductive health care to populations that did not have access to health services.&nbsp; The health project of the CLP aimed to improve maternal, newborn and child health (MNCH), and ultimately intending to reduce maternal, neonatal and child mortality.&nbsp; This goal is aligned with the health goals of the Ministry of Public Health and Population (MoPHP), as well as USAID's MNCH and Reproductive Health (RH), Family Planning (FP), and Nutrition priorities.&nbsp; This evaluation of the CLP Health Program aims to provide USAID with recommendations to inform the design of future health programs in Yemen and similar fragile states.&nbsp; To this end, the evaluation assessed: (1) the quality of the program design and the strategic and operational approach; (2) the quality planning, monitoring, data quality and reporting; and (3) the efficiency and effectiveness of the program.&nbsp; There were improvements seen in access to and the quality of health services during the life of the project.&nbsp; Health-sector activities related to private provider midwife (PPM) and mobile medical team (MMTs) were particularly effective in contributing to improved health access in rural areas.&nbsp; From 2011-2013 9 health centers were rehabilitated: (1) the numbers of assisted births in specific areas increased from 206 in 2011 to 894 in 2013;(2) the project made key investments in training; (3) the project can claim credit for 352 midwives being trained between 2011 and 2013; and (4) during that same period, 213 other staff were trained in maternal-child care.&nbsp; The original hypothesis of the project's logic model -- that health service delivery would contribute to national political stability and peace -- remains undetermined.&nbsp; The lack of counterfactuals and the existence of other numerous extraneous driving factors make it difficult to measure any attribution.&nbsp; The CLP health project demonstrated reasonable resilience in re-inventing itself in response to changing conditions in Yemen and evolving analyses and priorities.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)</p>",Cover title: End of project evaluation of the health program of the community livelihoods project (CLP) ~|~_©_~|~ [Task] order number 1,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,RAN-I-01-09-00016-00 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00016-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-01-09-00016 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00016,,3/1/2014 0:00,,Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Efficiency ~|~_©_~|~ Family planning behavior ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Health facilities ~|~_©_~|~ Livelihood ~|~_©_~|~ Reproductive health ~|~_©_~|~ Rural areas,Yemen,279-A-00-10-00032-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00K33P.pdf,1060 KB,"001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

PA-00K-2WJ,"Wellness and Agriculture for Life Advancement (WALA) is a five-year Title II Multi-Year Assistance Program (MYAP) funded by USAID to prevent and mitigate food insecurity in southern Malawi. &nbsp;WALA targets the most vulnerable communities and households, ensuring holistic provision of services to the selected groups. &nbsp;In the original design, targeted groups are comprised of households that have small and marginal farms, are female-headed, host chronically ill persons (tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS), are food insecure, and/or host orphans. &nbsp;WALA is implemented in the eight most food insecure districts of southern Malawi: Nsanje, Chikwawa, Thyolo, Mulanje, Zomba, Machinga, Chiradzulu and Balaka. &nbsp;The goal of WALA is to improve the food security of 214,974 chronically food insecure households in 39 Traditional Authorities in eight districts in southern Malawi by 2014 through strategic objectives in: (1) maternal and child health and nutrition (MCHN); (2) agriculture, natural resource management (NRM), irrigation and economic activity; and (3) disaster risk reduction. &nbsp;The evaluation assessed the results of program and how the program management and implementation affected and/or supported program achievements. &nbsp;This will inform future Food for Peace and USAID development programming in Malawi. &nbsp;The specific program objectives were: (1) to carry out a comparative analysis (bivariate and multivariate) of baseline and endline surveys to assess the changes in the indicators (program result) as outlined in the indicator performance tracking table (IPTT); (2) to identify program strategies, structures, systems and interventions that contributed to or impeded the achievement of intended results of program interventions and links between inputs and results with gender focus; (3) to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of technical, managerial and resource management strategies; (4) to assess progress made in responding to the midterm evaluation recommendations; (5) to assess the synergy between various WALA program components including linkages with Government of Malawi and other development programs (e.g., Positive Action for Community Transformation (IMPACT), Water for Irrigation for Life Advancement (WILA), MCHN+), and how the linkages enhance the program performance; (6) to assess the sustainability of the program outcomes; (7) to list the major successes and challenges faced by the WALA program and how well these challenges were addressed; (8) to extract and report on lessons learned to inform future Food for Peace program designs; and (9) to make specific recommendations on improving strategies and program interventions for future programming and/or scale-up. &nbsp;Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","""A Title II MYAP Funded by USAID Food for Peace"" ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Wellness and agriculture for life advancement (WALA)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-FFP-A-09-00001,,8/1/2014 0:00,,Food for Peace Title II ~|~_©_~|~ Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Maternal child health care ~|~_©_~|~ Malnutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Child nutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Maternal nutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Disadvantaged groups ~|~_©_~|~ Crop yield ~|~_©_~|~ Poverty reduction ~|~_©_~|~ Rural areas ~|~_©_~|~ Natural resource management ~|~_©_~|~ Irrigation ~|~_©_~|~ Disaster planning,Malawi,AID-FFP-A-09-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00K2WJ.pdf,1623 KB,007337 - Catholic Relief Services (CRS),,007648 - USAID.

PA-00K-2VF,"This report presents the findings of the final performance evaluation of the Monitoring Nepal's Peace Process and Constitution Drafting Process (MNPPCDP) project. &nbsp;The MNPPCDP project initially conducted district-based monitoring of selected aspects of the political transition in Nepal, and then grew to include monitoring of voter registration in advance of the November 2013 Constituent Assembly (CA) elections and fielding an international mission to observe the CA elections. &nbsp; Over the span of the project, program documents associated with this project make it clear that the project was much more concerned with generating information to inform elite (""key stakeholder"") decision-making than with the wide dissemination of information to ""Nepali citizens.""&nbsp;This evaluation seeks to assess the veracity of the following inter-connected hypotheses: (1) information generated by The Carter Center's (TCC's) monitoring reached and was consumed by the intended ""key stakeholders"" (and perhaps also citizens more generally); and (2) TCC-generated information, analysis and suasion influenced the decision-making of key stakeholders in ways that contributed to sustaining the peace process. &nbsp;More specifically, the main research questions include: (1) how effective was the program in engaging women, youth, dalits, differently abled and other marginalized groups during the monitoring of peace and constitution drafting processes and in bringing their issues to influence these processes [and] do citizens feel that their voices have been heard through this program; (2) how have the findings of TCC's analytical work such as field visit reports and press releases contributed to policy level decisions and to help shape programs and strategies of stakeholders such as CSOs, USAID projects, Election Commission of Nepal (ECN), Government of Nepal and donor communities [and]&nbsp;&nbsp;what other information would have been more helpful for the stakeholders; (3) in what ways have the report on ""limited observation of the ECN's voter registration program"" contributed to strengthening Election Commission's voter registration process [and] what recommendations from TCC's 2013 CA election observation report and/or other reports are being implemented for the June 2014 by-election and future local elections; and (4) what are further opportunities and challenges for making the long-term observation process more efficient and effective? &nbsp;Evaluation conclusions were that given the political context in Nepal circa 2009-2013, a case can be made that long-term monitoring of the peace process by the Carter Center was valuable for the following reasons: (1) it addressed the lack of credible information coming from the regions; (2) given the multi-faceted nature of the peace process, there was value in having a single organization that could deal holistically with all the elements of the peace process: local level peace and security, the constitutional process and the electoral process; (3) there was an openness -- perhaps even a desire -- on the part of most key political actors to have a neutral international actor that could, in the name of the CPA, help to resolve political impasses and also help keep any one group from behaving in ways that would cause the peace process to collapse; and&nbsp;(4) President Carter had experience and credibility with most key actors and wasn't too threatening to the Indian government. &nbsp;Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","Evaluated project title: Monitoring Nepal's peace process and constitution drafting process (MNPPCDP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: DRG learning, evaluation, and research (DRG-LER)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-M-13-00013,,8/1/2014 0:00,,Constitutions ~|~_©_~|~ Elections ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Observation ~|~_©_~|~ Political participation ~|~_©_~|~ Voter registration ~|~_©_~|~ Voters ~|~_©_~|~ Voting,Nepal,AID-367-A-09-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00K2VF.pdf,571 KB,040818 - NORC at the University of Chicago,,"040194 - USAID.

PA-00K-2NV,"The Improved Basic Education in Cambodia project's strategic objective is to improve access, quality, and relevance of basic education in Cambodia.&nbsp; More specifically, the IBEC project is to increase lower secondary school enrollments, retention, and completion rates, providing Cambodia's adolescent youth population with an opportunity to be better educated and lead productive lives.&nbsp; The IBEC project targets selected schools in three provinces, Kampong Cham, Kratie and Siem Reap.&nbsp; There are four inter-related, mutually reinforcing, and complementary components to achieving this overarching goal.&nbsp; These four main components include: (1) local NGO and government capacity building &amp; advocacy for sustainability; (2) more equitable school access; (3) improved school management and community involvement; and (4) improved educational relevance.&nbsp; The development hypothesis underlying the IBEC project is that a more relevant curriculum, combined with better trained teachers and school managers would encourage more students to attend lower secondary school and to stay long enough to complete the lower secondary cycle.&nbsp; Improved physical facilities (wells for drinking water, sanitary latrines, life skills laboratories, etc.) were also believed to play a positive role in inducing students to attend and remain in school.&nbsp; In addition, a limited number of scholarships would directly help vulnerable youth obtain a quality education.&nbsp; In total, these improvements were to create a better educated youth population who will have a knowledge base more relevant to the economic needs of Cambodia, with skills more compatible with the demands of the local job market.&nbsp; The purpose of the evaluation is to assess the project's accountability and extent to which it was able to meet its intended objectives at all result levels.&nbsp; The evaluation also documents lessons learned and best practices, as well as providing recommendations to inform evidence-based future programming.&nbsp; The evaluation questions guiding this performance evaluation were: (1) to what extent did the project achieve its objectives; (2) among all the interventions implemented by the partner, identify the interventions that have been the most effective in achieving the project objectives; (3) what are key lessons learned?&nbsp; The end-of-project performance evaluation provides evidence to confirm that IBEC largely achieved its objectives to improve access, quality and relevance of basic education in Cambodia.&nbsp; Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question.

PA-00K-2F6,"The Programme de Bonne Gouvernance (PBG) is a five-year project (2009-2014).&nbsp; PBG focused on three tracks -- civil society, parliaments and local government -- that correspond to the three Intermediate Results: (1) citizens demand accountability; (2) selected parliaments are more democratic and effective; and (3) laws, policies and procedures for decentralization are established and implemented.&nbsp; By mid-course in the project, PBG concentrated on support to revenue management by twelve Decentralized Territorial Entities (Entites territoriales decentralisees or&nbsp;ETDs) with citizen participation.&nbsp; As specified in the scope of work, the main evaluation objectives are to determine answers to the following two questions: (1) what is the performance of the program in strengthening institutions and increasing citizen demand; and (2) to what extent is the project theory of change valid that strengthened institutions and increased demand result in better service delivery? &nbsp;In addition, this performance evaluation seeks to answer the following evaluation questions: (1) do institutions have increased capacity and strength; (2) has there been an increased citizen demand for accountable governance; (3) were there improvements in delivery of public services in the target local governments; (4) what lessons have been learned regarding implementation strategies; and (5) what are findings related to cross-cutting themes of gender and urban-rural impact?&nbsp; Some key evaluation questions address the effectiveness of revenue generation among the ETDs or Decentralized Territorial Entity (Entites territoriales decentralisees), and the most effective methods to achieve these results.&nbsp; The overall evaluation conclusion is that the project was very well-managed despite a highly challenging context and vast project scope.&nbsp; It was also concluded that working with local government on a pilot basis has tentatively confirmed the fundamental principle of citizen participation for effective decentralization.

PA-00K-265,"The Ghana National Strategic Plan (NSP) for HIV and AIDS aims to reach 80% of all key populations by 2015 with a comprehensive package of HIV services, including prevention, treatment, and support.&nbsp; Under the strategy, a number of evidence-based services have been rolled out to key populations nationwide by the Ghana Aids Commission (GAC) and implementing partners.&nbsp; This evaluation, therefore, was conducted as a mid-point assessment in order to describe the achievements and challenges of the ongoing implementation of the National HIV Prevention Program for female sex workers (FSW) and men who have sex with men (MSM) in Ghana.&nbsp; This performance evaluation employed a mixed-methods approach in order to assess the following key study aims: (1) describe how services are being delivered; (2) document barriers and facilitators to accessing health services for MSM and FSW as well as the larger structural influences on sexual and health seeking behaviors such as stigma and discrimination; (3) assess whether organizations directly providing services to FSW and MSM have standard operating procedures, functional supervision mechanisms, monitoring and reporting systems, and administrative, management, and planning capacity; and (5) document efforts to increase stakeholder and organizational coordination and to address social, cultural, religious, political, and legal barriers to HIV prevention efforts among FSW and MSM.&nbsp; Study findings suggest that leadership provided by the GAC and the Technical Working Group (TWG) are strong, and while some greater capacity building and standardization could improve data collection and reporting and standardize service availability, organizations are striving to adhere to the service package and to provide a high quality product.&nbsp; This effort has resulted in high demand for services and a positive reputation for respectful treatment and confidentiality among FSW and MSM.&nbsp; Overall, recommendations focus on the ways in which the program can continue to be strengthened and expanded to better meet demand for services without sacrificing the reputation for service quality upon which that demand is predicated.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Also known as: A performance evaluation of the national HIV prevention program for female sex workers and men who have sex with men in Ghana ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: MEASURE evaluation phase III,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,GHA-A-00-08-00003-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GHA-A-00-08-00003,,7/1/2014 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Condoms ~|~_©_~|~ Crimes ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Health care costs ~|~_©_~|~ Plastics ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion ~|~_©_~|~ Sexes,Ghana,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00K265.pdf,2433 KB,000821 - University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

PA-00J-ZD7,"The Tunisia Transition Initiative (TTI) program was designed to support Tunisians in their pursuit of a democratic society by creating viable space for the transition to succeed. &nbsp;The transition was a result of revolution in response to long-simmering grievances, including inequality among regions, the marginalization of social groups (i.e. unemployed, youth, rural women), and the highly centralized state (directly in response to the events of the Arab Spring). &nbsp;Despite disappointment in the pace of reform, many citizens still see the transition as a real opportunity to promote social modernization and democracy, strengthen civil society, give greater voice to youth and women, and rebuild regional and local governance. &nbsp;In an effort to support the transition, activities focused on civic engagement, women and youth political participation, civil society organization capacity, and countering violent extremism, among others. &nbsp;The evaluation focused in general on assessing two primary aspects of the TTI program: (1) strategic approach to programming, examining in particular the adaptability to changes in the political landscape, relevance to critical issues or events of the transition, and overall strategic targeting; and (2) the effectiveness and impact (intended and unintended) of the TTI program, primarily through the lens of TTI's four priority sub-objectives. &nbsp;Recent studies, news reports, and interviews with country experts, staff and grantees point to a rise in extremist violence throughout Tunisia, including in areas where TTI programming is being implemented. &nbsp;There is a growing concern among civil society organizations regarding what they perceive as increasing levels of anti-establishment beliefs and attitudes among youth. &nbsp;These beliefs include an alienation from the political and economic system that took over ""their revolution"" and that has not addressed corruption or unemployment. &nbsp;This dynamic speaks to cognitive radicalization processes referenced by the Countering Violent Extremism (CVE) Desk Study and Framework for the Office of Transition Initiatives/Tunisia &nbsp;(OTI/Tunisia) and further validates CVE programming. &nbsp;As such, the evaluation team found that the program is responding to an evolving context of a growing social dynamic that poses a serious threat to the political transition. &nbsp;Specific evaluation analyses on program findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided in detail. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified).",Cover title: Tunisia transition initiative final evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Tunisia transition initiative (TTI) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Program development quickly III (PDQ III),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-I-13-00007,,6/1/2014 0:00,,Societies in transition ~|~_©_~|~ Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Civic action ~|~_©_~|~ Women ~|~_©_~|~ Youth ~|~_©_~|~ Violence ~|~_©_~|~ Terrorism ~|~_©_~|~ Political reconciliation ~|~_©_~|~ Social change ~|~_©_~|~ Learning motivation,Tunisia,AID-OAA-I-13-00007,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JZD7.pdf,2068 KB,"003950 - Training Resources Group, Inc.

Program activities have included a wide range of API control activities on both the animal and human health sides.&nbsp; Indonesia has received special attention from USAID and the international community because it has the highest cumulative number (as per 24 January 2014) of reported human cases (195), deaths (163) and fatality rate (83%), among the countries where H5N1 is endemic in poultry.&nbsp; The purpose of this evaluation of the API program was to review and evaluate its progress and performance, since the last program assessment in 2009.&nbsp; The evaluation addressed the following nine questions: (1) to what extent has the program activities made an impact to mitigate the risks of influenza on humans and animals; (2) to what extent has the program activities made an impact to strengthen animal and human health systems in Indonesia; (3) to what extent has the program activity strengthen capacity of the national and sub-national (province and district) government, private sector, community, and other stakeholders; (4) what is the contribution of each project to the overall USAID API program goals; (5) how replicable, adaptable/adoptable, sustainable are the programs/program components; (6) how can the program design, management, and implementation become more efficient, effective and relevant toward achieving program goals; (7) how effective has the collaboration/coordination among the programs been in maximizing efforts and achieving greater results; (8) how can local and national ownership and future commitment to continued implementation of good practices/lesson learned be enhanced; and (9) what are the key focus points needed by the country to sustain an effective control effort for API?&nbsp; Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Project title: Global health tech bridge III (GH tech bridge 3) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health tech bridge IV (GH tech bridge 4),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-C-13-00032 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-C-13-00113,,2/1/2014 0:00,,Influenza A (H5N1) (Avian flu) ~|~_©_~|~ Death ~|~_©_~|~ Endemic diseases ~|~_©_~|~ Poultry ~|~_©_~|~ Disease transmission ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Commercial farming ~|~_©_~|~ Monitoring ~|~_©_~|~ Vaccines ~|~_©_~|~ Disinfectants,Indonesia,GPO-I-02-06-00007-00 ~|~_©_~|~ GPO-I-00-06-00007-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GPO-I-02-06-00007 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GPO-I-00-06-00007,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JZ5M.pdf,1725 KB,"011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

PB-AAA-655,"To address the deficit in government justice services and reduce the incidence of social practices that Afghans themselves recognize as harmful to their communities, USAID developed the Rule of Law Stabilization Program - Informal Component (RLS-I).&nbsp; RLS-I addresses the primary objectives of: (1) strengthening Traditional Dispute Resolution (TDR) mechanisms, (2) enhancing linkages between the formal and informal systems, and (3) facilitating the resolution of longstanding and destabilizing disputes.&nbsp; These program objectives fall under broader United States Government (USG) rule of law and stabilization objectives and follow the development hypothesis that efforts at improving and strengthening TDR will increase stability in the project districts, where stability is indicated by perceptions of increased access to justice, increased confidence in TDR mechanisms, and a decrease in longstanding, potentially destabilizing disputes.&nbsp; The following key findings of the Phase 3 evaluation build on Phase 2 evaluation findings covering the period of October 2011-September 2012.&nbsp; There are both continuities and differences across each evaluation round, both of which provide insight into the programmatic setting and trajectory of RLS-I outcomes and impacts.&nbsp; The primary lessons provided by this research effort demonstrate the link between elder capacity building and improved disputant perception predicted by the RLS-I development hypothesis, show that regional differences in program setting are associated with differences in outcomes, and suggest a possible J-curve&nbsp; impact trajectory where RLS-I may raise community (evaluation respondents) expectations before program participants have fully adopted RLS-I learning content and disputants witness positive changes in elders' adjudication practice.

PA-00J-XPM,"While traditional dispute resolution (TDR) mechanisms have been remarkably resilient over the past 30 years in Afghanistan, decades of conflict have weakened TDR capabilities in many areas by disrupting the informal justice institutions through which elders and other locally legitimate actors adjudicate disputes.&nbsp; Lack of access to justice, whether it comes from formal or informal providers, is a source of instability that USAID Afghanistan is addressing through programs such as Rule of Law Stabilization - Informal Component (RLS-I).&nbsp; The RLS-I program was designed to achieve the following three objectives: (1) strengthen TDR mechanisms; (2) strengthen linkages between informal and formal justice sectors; and (3) develop approaches that successfully resolve long-term intractable disputes.&nbsp; This evaluation measured the achievements and challenges of RLS-I in six provinces of Afghanistan: Baghlan, Faryab, Kandahar, Nangarhar, Uruzgan and Wardak.&nbsp; A set of mixed quantitative and qualitative methods were used for data collection.&nbsp; The evaluation found strong performance on some RLS-I program objectives and weaker performance on others.&nbsp; Direct beneficiaries that participated in training activities for TDR actors -- a central facet of the RLS-I program -- noted general satisfaction with the training experience and reported gaining valuable knowledge of legal principles and procedural justice.&nbsp; These TDR actors also seemed to put their training to good use, a significant majority of the indirect beneficiary population reported that the quality of traditional justice had improved compared to before the RLSI program.&nbsp; Further, direct and the indirect beneficiary population alike reported a reduction in the incidence of cultural practices that are harmful to women such as baad (the exchange of daughters to settle disputes or debts).&nbsp; Confidence in the ability of TDR actors to resolve disputes generally increased, though this strengthening of TDR mechanisms was not accompanied by a perceived strengthening of the formal justice system or a greater rate of referrals of cases from traditional to formal justice providers.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Also known as: Rule of law support-informal final evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Rule of law stabilization-informal component (RLS-I),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-306-O-14-00051,,5/1/2014 0:00,,Artists ~|~_©_~|~ Business enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Litigation ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion ~|~_©_~|~ Rule of law ~|~_©_~|~ Violence against women ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Afghanistan,AID-306-C-12-00013,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JXPM.pdf,2640 KB,040788 - Sayara Research,,008504 - USAID.

PA-00J-W27,"Kenya Dairy Sector Competitiveness Program &nbsp;(KDSCP) worked in eight milkshed locations across the Central and Rift Valley provinces. &nbsp;The program's primary goal was to increase smallholder household incomes through the sale of quality milk. &nbsp;Its secondary goal was to help transform the Kenyan dairy industry into a globally competitive and regional market leader by eliminating inefficiencies and lowering production and processing costs throughout the dairy value chain, while working to ensure that Kenyan milk met domestic and international quality standards. &nbsp;Thus, the program aimed to improve the competitiveness of Kenya's dairy industry and increase economic benefits to stakeholders throughout the entire dairy value chain, with an emphasis on smallholder farmers. &nbsp;It also integrated the crosscutting themes of gender and youth and sustainable resource management and utilization. &nbsp;The project implements three activities that focus on primary value chain constraints and opportunities: (1) KDSCP works to improve the business operating environment by building the capacity of institutions that serve the dairy industry and facilitating a review of national policies, regulations, acts, and standards to ensure consumer safety and market expansion, especially for the export market; (2) KDSCP works to increase the operational efficiency of small business organizations in the industry, particularly those serving farmers working directly with the program; and (3) KDSCP supports increased access to business development services by dairy enterprises, including smallholder farmers. &nbsp;The evaluation team was required to respond specifically to five questions posed by USAID in the evaluation statement of work (SOW): (1) to what extent did KDSCP meet the intended goals [and] if the goal was not achieved, why not; (2) what were the internal and external enabling factors that contributed to meeting or not meeting the intended goals; (3) what is the evidence concerning the sustainability of the end results produced by the program; (4) to what extent did the program employ new approaches; and (5) to what extent were environmental compliance mitigation measures identified at the beginning of the project effectively implemented, including Pesticides Evaluation Reports and Safe Use Action Plans? &nbsp;The following are lessons learned from the implementation of KDSCP and the project evaluation: (1) artificial insemination is an excellent means for small dairy farmers to progressively improve the genetic foundation of their dairy herd to increase milk production and create greater market value for their dairy cattle; (2) providing adequate quantities of nutritious feed and water to dairy cattle throughout the dry season will mitigate the effects of seasonal declines in milk production; (3) on-farm silage making is a low-cost means for preparing and storing animal feed by small farmers; and (4) to better collect information, USAID evaluations should be conducted before the project is completed. &nbsp;Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",'Kenya Support Program' ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Kenya dairy sector competitiveness program (KDSCP),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-623-TO-13-00015 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-623-I-12-00001,,7/1/2013 0:00,,Agriculture ~|~_©_~|~ Diseases ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Economics ~|~_©_~|~ Marketing ~|~_©_~|~ Nutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Property,Kenya,623-C-00-08-00020-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-623-C-00-08-00020,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JW27.pdf,1926 KB,"003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

PA-00J-VKC,"In 2008, USAID procured two HIV Testing and Counseling (HTC) projects, Angaza Zaidi and Universal HIV and AIDS Intervention for Counseling and Testing (UHAI-CT), both with indicators and targets aimed at contributing to increased use of HIV/AIDS prevention to care services and products. &nbsp;The primary goal of the Angaza Zaidi project is to improve the health of Tanzanians by ensuring that they know their HIV status, take steps to protect themselves, and have better quality of life if infected. &nbsp;The Angaza Zaidi technical approach uses three modalities: (1) integrated voluntary HTC; (2) stand-alone HTC; and (3) community-based HTC. Implementation is guided by strategies of: (1) targeting; (2) decentralization and community engagement; (3) branding; (4) partnerships and sub-granting; (5) advocacy; and (6) counseling and testing systems strengthening. &nbsp;The primary goal of the UHAI-CT project is to increase access to testing and counselling services to Tanzanian families, couples, and individuals, particularly those at high risk, and to link those found to be HIV-positive to relevant HIV care, treatment, and prevention services. &nbsp;The UHAI-CT technical approach is guided by the principles of: (1) innovation; (2) rapid expansion; (3) diversity of strategies; (4) quality; (5) sustainability; (6) strong links to HIV care; and (7) treatment and cost effectiveness. &nbsp;UHAI-CT activities are implemented using Providor Initiated Testing and Counseling (PITC) and community outreach. &nbsp;Main questions for this program evaluation were the following: (1) has each project achieved its stated goals and objectives; (2) what are each project's strengths, weaknesses, and gaps in planning, management, routine data use, and service delivery; (3) how did each project strategically use different HTC modalities to achieve its goals and objects [and] were these modalities effective in reaching the target populations [and] what are the lessons learned from successful interventions that merit continuation or replication, better practices, significant products and tools for possible dissemination and replication; (4) was each project able to successfully refer newly-identified HIV-positive clients to HIV care and treatment facilities [and] what systems were used during these referrals; (5) how has each project built capacity and/or institutionalized its practices to heighten opportunities for sustainability [and] were these efforts successful. &nbsp;The evaluation team concludes that both projects met many, but not all, of their objectives and targets. &nbsp;Although the evaluation documents several weaknesses, both projects had more strengths than weaknesses. &nbsp;While all of the HTC modalities played a significant role in increasing HTC and reaching different populations, they were not used strategically to reach populations at high risk. &nbsp;Among a number of key lessons learned by both projects is the necessity for a decentralized approach to project management in Tanzania to facilitate project monitoring, communication, and stakeholder engagement. &nbsp;Neither project created a robust, traceable linkage system to ensure HIV-positive clients are linked to care and treatment. &nbsp;However, both projects made measurable progress towards building the capacity of local institutions and institutionalizing practices for HTC.

PA-00J-TJJ,"The poverty reduction by increasing the competitiveness of enterprises (PRICE) project was implemented between 2008 and 2013 and follows several other USAID enterprise development projects. &nbsp;The main objective of this program was to reduce poverty sustainably by increasing enterprise competitiveness across three main sectors in Bangladesh: horticulture, aquaculture, and leather. &nbsp;Specific PRICE objectives across the three sectors included improving pro-poor economic opportunities, workforce skills, social compliance practices, governance practices related to economic growth and poverty reduction, small and medium enterprise (SME) development, growth of the non-textile private sector, and the capacity and use of knowledge management systems. &nbsp;The purpose of the PRICE final performance evaluation is to assess the effectiveness of the PRICE project in achieving its program objectives, to evaluate any constraints to achieving expected results, and to provide recommendations and lessons learned for future private-sector competitiveness and value chain development programs. &nbsp;There were six&nbsp;questions guiding the evaluation process: (1) how successful has PRICE been in increasing sector competitiveness and removing constraints at the local, national, and international levels and is success limited to a few PRICE beneficiaries/enterprises and selected geographic locations; (2) as suggested in the mid-term evaluation, how has PRICE improved the value chain market linkages to complement its production focus; (3) how did the project extension and 2011 re-alignment of PRICE's focus to support horticulture in the Feed the Future region affect PRICE's effectiveness and results achievement; (4) are women more empowered across the three value chains than they otherwise would have been as a result of the PRICE interventions and what has been the impact of PRICE interventions and trainings in creating jobs for women in the value chains; (5) how effective have the SME and workforce development initiatives by PRICE been in the leather sector growth; and (6) what institutional capacity-building lessons learned from PRICE should USAID carry forward to future value chain, hunger, and poverty alleviation investments? &nbsp;The conclusion of key findings summarizes the PRICE project as an overall success, with significant improvements made in increasing competitiveness in the horticulture, aquaculture, and leather sectors in Bangladesh. &nbsp;Many goals were achieved, and future projects can build on PRICE's established practices. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","Evaluated project title: Poverty reduction by increasing the competiveness of enterprises (PRICE) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Learning, evaluation, and analysis project (LEAP)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-C-11-00169,,1/1/2014 0:00,,Agricultural occupations ~|~_©_~|~ Farmers ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Gender equity ~|~_©_~|~ Manufacturing ~|~_©_~|~ Rural areas ~|~_©_~|~ Value chains ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Bangladesh,388-C-00-08-00021-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JTJJ.pdf,1914 KB,"040314 - Optimal Solutions Group, LLC",,"013891 - USAID.

RAIN's experience has demonstrated that even when environmental, economic, political and social conditions are stressed, market systems are dynamic and continue to operate in the stressed state.&nbsp; In addition to this, it has shown that even in the most complex and strained environments, if market systems are supported to overcome key obstacles, the private sector responds to opportunities and incentives to bring change to markets that work for the poor.&nbsp; This experience also indicates that&nbsp; subsidized service provisions have a distorting effect, undermining the viability of existing or emerging private sector investment.&nbsp; In order to prevent this, relief operations should be designed to meet immediate needs while minimizing distortions, avoiding undermining long-term programming and contributing to positive market system change, if possible.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Project title: Revitalizing agricultural/pastoral incomes and new markets for enhanced resilience and recovery (RAIN+) ~|~_©_~|~ Earlier project title: Revitalizing agricultural/pastoral incomes and new markets (RAIN),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,DFD-A-00-09-00087-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-DFD-A-00-09-00087,,2/1/2014 0:00,,Agricultural production ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Drought damage ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Income ~|~_©_~|~ Livestock ~|~_©_~|~ Rain ~|~_©_~|~ Rural areas,Ethiopia,DFD-A-00-09-00087-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-DFD-A-00-09-00087,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JSRQ.pdf,1467 KB,013649 - Mercy Corps,,000624 - USAID.

PA-00J-S5Q,"The USAID-funded Sudan Transition and Conflict Mitigation (STCM) program aimed to establish and manage a quick-response mechanism that would strengthen Sudanese confidence and capacity to address the causes and consequences of political conflict, violence, and instability. &nbsp;Expectations were that the STCM program would reduce the effects and causes of instability in the rapidly shifting environment of Sudan, particularly in the north-south border/transitional areas, the Three Areas (Abyei, Blue Nile, and Southern Kordofan), during the lead up to the southern secession referendum in January 2011 and potential independence of South Sudan in July. &nbsp;Post-secession expectations were that the program would further mitigate tension in the border areas, as well as Darfur and Khartoum. &nbsp; Although STCM is mentioned throughout the report as a 'program' it is better understood as a specialized tactical tool to provide strategically targeted support to transition and conflict mitigation activities. &nbsp;The independent performance evaluation of STCM will assist USAID/Sudan in determining: (1) the effectiveness and appropriateness of the overall approach to conflict mitigation programming and choice of funding mechanism; (2) the degree to which the implementing partner ensured a timely and cost-effective response to emerging needs in providing peace dividends, promoting community-level reconciliation, and strengthening local capacity for conflict mitigation; and (3) lessons learned that may guide the future of USAID/Sudan's conflict mitigation programming in Sudan. &nbsp;Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",Evaluated project title: Sudan transition and conflict mitigation (STCM),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-667-TO-13-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00016 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00016-00,,10/1/2013 0:00,,Agriculture ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Economics ~|~_©_~|~ Grants ~|~_©_~|~ Management ~|~_©_~|~ Mass media ~|~_©_~|~ Science ~|~_©_~|~ Technology,Sudan,AID-DOT-I-01-08-00050 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-DOT-I-00-08-00050 ~|~_©_~|~ DOT-I-01-08-00050-00 ~|~_©_~|~ DOT-I-00-08-00050-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JS5Q.pdf,927 KB,"001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

PA-00J-RCZ,"The Comprehensive Partnership between the United States and Indonesia identifies the creation of education partnerships as a top priority. In furtherance of this objective, USAID/Indonesia launched the University Partnerships (UP) program in December 2009 to help improve the quality and relevance of higher education in Indonesia.&nbsp; This evaluation of the fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth partnership awards was the third of four sets of evaluations of the partnerships.&nbsp; The topics of the four partnerships evaluated were: (1) UP#5 -- adaptation to climate risk in Indonesia; (2) UP#6 -- strengthening health systems in Indonesia: (3) UP#7 -- Indonesian marine biotechnology; and (4) UP#8 -- supporting Indonesian geothermal education capacity building.&nbsp; The purposes of the evaluation were to: (1) assess the extent of the knowledge and skills transfer that has occurred between the lead U.S. university and the Indonesian partners as subawardees; (2) determine the extent or level of the capacity building that has taken place within the partnerships; (3) assess the effectiveness of the project interventions between the partners to improve teaching and research services; (4) assess whether the projects are sustainable and have achieved project objectives; (5) obtain lessons learned from the partnerships that can be applied to the future direction of the UP program; and 6) demonstrate how institutions have achieved measurable improvements in the quality and relevance of their teaching and research.&nbsp; The evaluation team was asked to address the following five questions: (1) what are the specific knowledge and skills and the institutional capacity building that have occurred as a result of the partnership; (2) what were the project interventions that were effective between the participating universities; (3) what unintended results have occurred; (4) what are the lessons learned from the partnership that may be replicated in future programs; and (5) what are the strengths and weaknesses of the partnerships?&nbsp; Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation question.

PB-AAA-234,"Pakistan's generally low investment in education, and specifically higher education, has severely affected the financial health of Pakistan's universities. &nbsp;In fiscal year (FY) 2007-08, the Government of Pakistan (GOP) cut the Higher Education Commission's (HEC) budget for recurring grants to universities by 21 percent. &nbsp;Also, since FY 2008-09, the GOP has consistently released less money than budgeted for development grants, which support scholarships, infrastructure (e.g., buildings, laboratory equipment) and other development projects, and pay the salaries of development project staff, all of which are crucial to strengthening the ability of Pakistan's universities to meet future needs. &nbsp;In moves that further aggravated the weak financial situation of universities, in FY 2008-09 the GOP mandated 20 percent increases in government employees' salaries (including those of university staff), but did not increase funding levels to cover these increases. &nbsp;In the same year, the GOP waived tuition and fees for 7,354 internally displaced students without increasing funding to the affected universities to cover the lost tuition revenue. &nbsp;USAID responded to the problems posed by these financial cuts to universities by providing two separate cash transfers to HEC. &nbsp;The overall objective of the First Cash Transfer was to expand the availability of university and technical education to students from conflict-affected areas. &nbsp;The transfer was intended to contribute to the ""Investing in People"" objective under the U.S. Foreign Assistance Framework, especially in the areas of higher education and social assistance. &nbsp;The Second Cash Transfer was intended to ""Increase research capacity, improve teaching techniques and laboratory facilities, and enhance the quality and applicability of academic degrees in academic disciplines related to agricultural sciences and hydrology."" It also supported other disciplines which support these sectors including environmental sciences, engineering and economics. &nbsp;The purpose of this evaluation is to determine whether the two cash transfers have achieved expected results. The evaluation should facilitate stakeholder accountability, assess project performance (e.g. effectiveness and relevance), and generate recommendations for improving future cash transfer programs and other programming to support higher education.

PA-00J-QFX,"Funded by the Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC), through its Threshold Project on Immunization (MCC-TPI), Imunizasaun Proteje Labarik (IPL) provides support to the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste's Ministry of Health (MOH) with the aims of improving immunization coverage and strengthening routine immunization services. &nbsp;The main project goal is to reach the MCC 'Immunization Coverage' target indicator, which is defined as the average of DPT3 and measles coverage rates in a number of countries receiving MCC support. &nbsp;At project start-up, the MCC target indicator to be reached over the project lifetime was an average DPT3 /measles coverage rate of 81.5%. &nbsp;The evaluation team undertook a qualitative assessment as directed by the statement of work (SOW) for the assignment, and designed a data collection and analysis approach to answer the following four evaluation questions: (1) to what extent has the project achieved its objective of improving the enabling environment for FP/RH in the three target states; (2) which advocacy activities were successful and had a positive impact and which ones had no or limited impact, and why; (3) what roles did traditional, religious and political leaders play in improving the enabling environment for FP/RH in the target states, and how has the development Research Projects Center (dRPC) contributed to this [and] how were these roles different for traditional/religious and political leaders in terms of effectiveness; and (4) what effect did the project's activities have on women and men from the community differently? &nbsp;Based on available data, it appears that IPL has achieved its main purpose of assisting the MOH to reverse a decline in national immunization coverage rates. &nbsp;The project has initiated a wide range of initiatives aimed at supporting and strengthening immunization services, and although a direct link between these activities and increased coverage cannot be proved, it seems likely that together, these have resulted in the rise in coverage rates observed. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",Submitted as: MCHIP Timor Leste IPL program review ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order: Imunizasaun proteje labarik (IPL) = Immunization protects children ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Maternal and child health integrated program (MCHIP),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,GHS-A-00-08-00002-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GHS-A-00-08-00002,,11/1/2013 0:00,,Demographic surveys ~|~_©_~|~ Diseases ~|~_©_~|~ Health ~|~_©_~|~ Immunizations ~|~_©_~|~ Management ~|~_©_~|~ Mass media,Timor-Leste,GHS-A-00-08-00002-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GHS-A-00-08-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JQFX.pdf,1020 KB,"005553 - John Snow, Inc.

PA-00J-QFV,"The ProJustice Program was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to address challenges faced by the Congolese judiciary while supporting reforms initiated by the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (GoDRC), as set forth in the 2006 constitution. &nbsp;Tetra Tech DPK implemented the ProJustice Program over the course of five years (September 2008&ndash;September 2013) with a budget of US $20,484,410. &nbsp;The main objective of the program was to develop an accessible and empowered justice system through improved judicial management, lower costs of access to justice, and a more informed and engaged public. &nbsp;ProJustice was designed around four main components, each with a corresponding core objective: (1) supporting the establishment of new judicial institutions; (2) more effective and transparent management of the judiciary and Ministry of Justice (MoJ); (3) more effective, transparent, and accessible court operations in pilot jurisdictions; and (4) increasing access to justice for vulnerable populations. &nbsp;This final performance evaluation helps to assess the validity of the program design and assumptions as well as the overall performance of the ProJustice Program, and to gauge the present landscape of the judiciary in the DRC. &nbsp;The specific objectives of this evaluation exercise are to: (1) make an overall independent assessment of the past performance of the ProJustice Program, with particular attention to the impact of program actions against its pre-established goals and objectives; and (2) identify key lessons learned and propose practical recommendations for the program and USAID/DRC for future rule of law (RoL) strategies. &nbsp;The evaluation found that the approach used by the program on both the supply and the demand sides of the justice system appears to have had a positive effect on the Congolese judicial institutions. &nbsp;With the exception of activities conducted under a fifth component, &ldquo;Windows of Opportunity,&rdquo; all four program components have been deemed appropriate, based upon data emerging from the evaluation. &nbsp;Several adjustments have been proposed to better support the justice sector and provide target communities with access to fair and transparent justice. &nbsp;The evaluation exercise and data confirm that the approach taken by the program was relevant and appropriate, addressing the needs and critical issues that the program set out to achieve. &nbsp;Although there were opportunities for improvement, overall the ProJustice project was successful in meeting its objectives. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","Cover title: Final evaluation : ProJustice program in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ~|~_©_~|~ ""USAID Contract Number AID-RAN-I-00-09-00015, Task Order Number AID-660-TO-13-00001""",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-660-TO-13-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00015 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00015-00,,1/1/2014 0:00,,Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Courts ~|~_©_~|~ Judicial reform ~|~_©_~|~ Judiciary ~|~_©_~|~ Litigation ~|~_©_~|~ Magistrates ~|~_©_~|~ Transparency ~|~_©_~|~ Violence against women,Congo DR,263-I-01-06-00019-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 263-I-00-06-00019-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-263-I-01-06-00019 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-263-I-00-06-00019,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JQFV.pdf,1183 KB,"011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

PA-00J-Q88,"The Community Development Program (CDP) represented one of USAID's longest-running stabilization efforts in Afghanistan.&nbsp; The program officially adopted stabilization objectives in September 2010 and shifted focus to primarily rural areas identified by USAID field staff in coordination with International Security Assistance Forces (ISAF).&nbsp; Despite changing program objectives, over its lifespan CDP implemented the same type of infrastructure projects, without relying on subcontractors.&nbsp; The evaluation team considered the following key questions: (1) were projects designed with the appropriate stakeholders, and did they meet the criteria for selection; (2) were community engagement processes effective; (3) were government engagement processes effective; (4) was laborer recruitment appropriately targeted and perceived to be fair; (5) were payment processes perceived to be effective, fair, and transparent; (6) were procurement processes perceived as fair, efficient, and transparent; (7) were training and maintenance plans well designed and effective; (8) how did stakeholders (including the community) perceive the project in terms of attribution and quality of work; (9) were monitoring systems effective; (10) was coordination between USAID and the Central Asian Development Group (CADG) effective, and (11) did the program meet its Performance Management Plan targets?&nbsp; The findings of this evaluation suggest that CDP was quick and flexible, and displayed a remarkable ability to work in some of Afghanistan's most difficult areas. In general, projects facilitated positive interactions between communities and the government and were positively perceived by communities.&nbsp; CDP's success can largely be attributed to its longevity and CADG's strong relationships with USAID, the Afghan government, and communities.&nbsp; By the final phase of the nearly five-year program, CDP systems were well honed.&nbsp; Directly implementing projects rather than relying on subcontractors allowed the program to be more responsive and to have better control over recruitment, implementation, and involvement of the Afghan government.&nbsp; However, CDP was not immune to the pressures of a challenging environment.&nbsp; Corruption was known to be a significant issue and this evaluation's findings indicate that it may have been more widespread than previously documented.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Evaluated project title: Community development program (CDP) ~|~_©_~|~ Task order title: Measuring impact of stabilization initiatives (MISTI),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-306-TO-12-00004 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-10-00002,,2/1/2014 0:00,,Community development ~|~_©_~|~ Stability ~|~_©_~|~ Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Political corruption ~|~_©_~|~ Risk ~|~_©_~|~ Civil-military relations ~|~_©_~|~ Internal conflict,Afghanistan,306-A-00-09-00511-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-306-A-00-09-00511,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JQ88.pdf,596 KB,"003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

PA-00J-Q5B,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">A performance evaluation was conducted of two USAID-funded human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing and counseling (HTC) projects in Tanzania.&nbsp; The first, a project titled ""Rapid Scale up of Innovative HIV Counseling and Testing Approaches on Tanzania Mainland,"" is known locally as Angaza Zaidi, and was implemented by African Medical and Research Foundation (AMREF) and partners starting in 2008 with a budget of $16.3 million over five years.&nbsp; The main goal of Angaza Zaidi was to increase the number of Tanzanians who know their HIV status and link those who test positive to care and treatment services.&nbsp; A non-profit affiliate of the Johns Hopkins University, Jhpiego, and partners received $16.5 million USD, also in 2008, to lead the other project, Universal HIV/AIDS Intervention for Counseling and Testing (UHAI-CT) over five years.&nbsp; UHAI-CT's main goal was to increase testing and counseling particularly among high-risk populations.&nbsp; Angaza Zaidi implemented HTC through stand-alone voluntary counseling and testing (VCT), integrated VCT and community outreach, while UHAI-CT implemented HTC through provider-initiated testing and counseling (PITC) and community outreach.&nbsp; The aim of this performance evaluation was to provide USAID/Tanzania, the Government of Tanzania, and other in-country stakeholders with an objective, independent assessment of the efficiency and quality of the performance of these two projects at the national, regional, facility and community-based service levels.&nbsp; To do this, the evaluation team used a cross-sectional design to evaluate the two projects and collected data using a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods in six regions: Iringa, Tabora, Njombe, Tanga, Kilimanjaro, and Dar es Salaam.&nbsp; The evaluation: (1) identifies achievements, implementation gaps and challenges; (2) documents lessons learned and best practices; and (3) provides key recommendations for future programming.&nbsp; The evaluation team concludes that both projects met many, but not all, of their objectives and targets.&nbsp; Although the evaluation documents several weaknesses, both projects had more strengths than weaknesses.&nbsp; While all of the HTC modalities played a significant role in increasing HTC and reaching different populations, they were not used strategically to reach populations at high risk.&nbsp; Among a number of key lessons learned by both projects is the necessity for a decentralized approach to project management in Tanzania to facilitate project monitoring, communication, and stakeholder engagement.&nbsp; Neither project created a robust, traceable linkage system to ensure HIV-positive clients are linked to care and treatment.&nbsp; However, both projects made measurable progress towards building the capacity of local institutions and institutionalizing practices for HTC.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)</p>",Evaluated project title: Rapid scale up of innovative HIV counseling and testing approaches on Tanzania mainland (also known as 'Angaza zaidi') ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Universal HIV and AIDS intervention for counseling and testing (UHAI-CT),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-621-TO-13-00004 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00016-00,,2/1/2014 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Business enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Counseling services ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Health facilities ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion ~|~_©_~|~ Questionnaires,Tanzania,621-A-00-08-00018-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 621-A-00-08-00019-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JQ5B.pdf,1687 KB,"001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

PA-00J-Q4Q,"The USAID Municipal Competitiveness Project (MCP) in El Salvador is a $11.2 million project which was designed to improve the competitiveness of Salvadoran municipalities through the development of a unique model with several inter-related components designed to: (1) enhance municipal effectiveness and efficiency; (2) measure the local business climate; (3) encourage private-public and inter-jurisdictional engagement and dialogue; and (4) provide incentive funds to encourage municipalities to mobilize financial resource for improving economic development and security.&nbsp; The purpose of this final performance evaluation of the MCP is to document the effectiveness of the project from its inception in October 2010 through September 2013 and to inform USAID and other stakeholders of opportunities for additional investments.&nbsp; The primary objectives of the evaluation are to: (1) document successes and shortcomings of the MCP approaches in order to determine their effectiveness in promoting municipal competitiveness and business enabling environments; (2) make recommendations for priority activities to ensure sustainability and increased private sector participation and improve competitiveness at the municipal level; (3) identify the level of success of the Domestic Finance for Development (DF4D) component in promoting Municipal Competitiveness Committee (MCC) participation in community crime prevention activities; (4) make recommendations on MCP approaches to encourage increased municipal revenues; and (5) offer suggestions on measuring municipal level investment in the country.&nbsp; The overall conclusion of this evaluation is that MCP is highly innovative and has made a significant contribution to municipal development in El Salvador.&nbsp; Clearly, developing a business-enabling environment within which local areas develop a culture of competitiveness is a long-term process, and it is a process that will likely require sustained interventions on the part of USAID and other development partners.&nbsp;&nbsp; Although the gains described in this report are still tentative in many MCP municipalities, the experiences accrued by the project have a potential to serve as a model for municipal development internationally for those countries that are pursuing municipal or other subnational development strategies that require some degree of decentralization.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)&nbsp;",'Evaluation report' ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Municipal competitiveness project (MCP) = Proyecto para la competitividad ~|~_©_~|~ municipal (PCM) ~|~_©_~|~ Spanish ed.: PA-00J-Q4R,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-519-O-14-00001,,1/1/2014 0:00,,Business enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Crimes ~|~_©_~|~ Investment ~|~_©_~|~ Municipal level ~|~_©_~|~ Private sector ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Revenues ~|~_©_~|~ Violence against women,El Salvador,EPP-I-00-04-00037-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JQ4Q.pdf,1860 KB,"001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

PA-00J-PRV,"The Transition and Persistence Project (TAP) was a three-year USAID-funded education project, implemented by Plan Ghana.&nbsp; The project aimed to increase junior high school (JHS) enrollment and completion rates in 156 JHSs across 13 districts in 4 regions (Brong Ahafo, Central, Eastern, and Greater Accra).&nbsp; TAP contributed to USAID's Strategic Objective 8 (SO8): ""Improved Quality of, and Access to, Basic Education."" &nbsp;The objectives of the TAP project were to: (1) increase the number of improved spaces available for JHS enrollment in targeted districts through building new facilities or rehabilitating existing facilities, (2) increase JHS enrollment in targeted districts by improving teacher quality, strengthening district level Ghana Education Service oversight, providing more diverse and innovative educational opportunities for children, promoting community involvement and ownership of the SIP process; and creating incentives and rewards for teachers, children, and communities for improving performance, (3) increase JHS completion rates by institutionalizing the processes and systems that will be used to increase enrollment.&nbsp; This evaluation was designed to explore the degree to which the desired changes were brought about due to the TAP interventions.&nbsp; The evaluation field work developed a sample based on disaggregating across the schools which exhibited the highest enrollment change and average and lowest enrollment change over the three year TAP intervention period (2010/11 to 2012/13); the evaluation also explored the degree to which interventions were effective and yielded the most promising results for replication. &nbsp;The evaluation study found that the TAP project recorded enormous improvements in increasing the spaces, improving the physical infrastructure and in reducing socio-economic barriers to JHS enrollment and completion for pupils and their families across 156 TAP schools in 13 districts of Ghana.&nbsp; The evaluation revealed that the TAP project was a highly valued intervention by all stakeholder groups interviewed, particularly teachers, communities and children.&nbsp; Evidence from interviews revealed that TAP interventions met the immediate practical needs of households and schools.&nbsp; Key stakeholders at the district and school levels also suggest that the TAP project should continue, with at most minor modifications.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Project title: Transition and persistence (TAP),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,641-A-00-10-00026-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-641-A-00-10-00026,,1/1/2014 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Boys ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Enrollment ~|~_©_~|~ Girls ~|~_©_~|~ Mathematics ~|~_©_~|~ Rural areas ~|~_©_~|~ Students,Ghana,641-A-00-10-00026-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-641-A-00-10-00026,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JPRV.pdf,787 KB,"040824 - Associates For Change (AFC) ~|~_©_~|~ 013207 - Plan International USA, Inc.",,008547 - USAID.

PA-00J-MR8,"The main objective of the School Water Supply, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH) and Quality Education Project is to improve access to water and sanitation services in schools in all 12 districts of Northern and Muchinga Provinces and to promote improved learning outcomes. &nbsp;The project intended to accomplish the following specific objectives: (1) promote education access, gender equity, girls education, teacher retention and improved health outcomes in Zambian schools; (2) improve water supply by rehabilitating or constructing water points using conventional and/or appropriate technologies; (3) improve sanitation services in basic schools by constructing latrines; (4) improve local capacity to maintain water and sanitation facilities; and (5) improve water, sanitation and hygiene education in basic schools. &nbsp;The evaluation addressed the following research questions: (1) to what extent were the project's targets achieved and why; (2) what was the level of functionality of the innovative WASH technologies and approaches and responsiveness of the beneficiaries to them in the project; (3) could the approaches applied in the project be replicated and managed sustainably by the local institutional framework for the Education and WASH sectors in Zambia; and (4) how relevant were the project interventions in improving student/teacher school attendance and retention? &nbsp;The evaluation team finds that the WASH Project has contributed significantly toward education in the schools that benefited. &nbsp;More of its benefits are yet to be incurred as its current outcome is sustained. &nbsp;The project is therefore recommended for extension to other schools in the Northern and Muchinga Province as well as other geographical areas in Zambia. &nbsp;Specific evaluation analyses on program findings, conclusions, and recommendations are provided in detail including: (1) extent to which the project achieved its targets; (2) findings on the innovative technologies introduced by the project; (3) feasibility of the project activities being replicated in other geographical areas and ability of local institutions to manage and sustain these technologies; and (4) establishing the relationship between provision of WASH facilities in schools, school attendance, and teacher retention. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-611-TO-13-00005 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00016-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00016,,11/1/2013 0:00,,School buildings ~|~_©_~|~ Water supply ~|~_©_~|~ Hygiene ~|~_©_~|~ Water quality ~|~_©_~|~ Quality of education ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Technological innovations ~|~_©_~|~ Diarrhea ~|~_©_~|~ Handwashing ~|~_©_~|~ Water pumps ~|~_©_~|~ Sanitation ~|~_©_~|~ School attendance ~|~_©_~|~ School dropouts ~|~_©_~|~ Reading instruction ~|~_©_~|~ Gender equality ~|~_©_~|~ Building construction,Zambia,611-A-00-09-00001-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-611-A-00-09-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JMR8.pdf,1489 KB,"001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

PA-00J-M2M,"<div>The Opportunities for Vulnerable Children (OVC) program represents a unique and highly commendable effort made by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to bring children with disabilities into Indonesia's mainstream education settings in a substantive manner. &nbsp;The program -- which only cost USD 9.3 million in 10 years or USD 930,000 a year on average -- contributed significantly to strengthening the Indonesian enabling educational environment for children with disabilities, in the following ways: (1) building substantial government bureaucratic and political support for inclusion of children with disabilities; (2) spearheading the development of national policies, such as recognition of ""resource teachers"" as a legitimate category of service, and 22 subnational policies that operationalized the national inclusive education policies; (3) helping stakeholders to lobby for and legitimize the development of budgets to support inclusive education, which will allow inclusive education initiatives to be funded post-OVC; and (4) changing parents' and community attitudes about the rights of children with disabilities to an education. &nbsp;The above was achieved by well-targeted use of short-term technical experts and ongoing engagement of very knowledgeable program personnel who understand how to work with and within the existing systems. &nbsp;However, without strategic and selective external technical support for deepening and broadening OVC accomplishments, full realization of OVC program benefits is at risk. &nbsp;There is also a risk that inclusive education will remain synonymous with special education, rather than special education falling under the umbrella of a functional inclusive education system. &nbsp;USAID's Education Strategy Goal 1 will ensure that 150 million children worldwide become readers in the early grades; however, most early grade reading assessments have not taken children with disabilities into account in testing protocols, data disaggregation, or ensuing programming. &nbsp;If USAID is able to act on the opportunity for disability-sensitive programming that the OVC program introduced, Indonesia can provide a valuable model on which to build in order to bring children with disabilities into this broader group of 150 million children. &nbsp;Failure of the government and donor community to further to deepen and extend OVC program achievements would be a significant and regrettable ""missed opportunity."" &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</div>",Evaluated project title: New opportunities for vulnerable children (N-OVC) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title also known as: Opportunities for vulnerable children (OVC),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-497-TO-13-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00008 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00008-00,,12/1/2013 0:00,,Children ~|~_©_~|~ Education ~|~_©_~|~ Nutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Students ~|~_©_~|~ Teachers,Indonesia,497-A-00-10-00019-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-497-A-00-10-00019,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JM2M.pdf,1882 KB,"040773 - GRM International ~|~_©_~|~ 006007 - AMEX International, Inc.",,"008558 - USAID.

PB-AAA-337,"The Lira Child Survival Project educated health workers and caregivers about early childhood development and simple actions they can take daily to support their infants was integrated as a key strategy. &nbsp;The project was implemented by Medical Teams International and the Lira District Health Office served a population of 124,379 and operated in Lira, Aromo and Ogur sub-counties of Lira District in Northern Uganda. &nbsp;The project used a two-pronged approach to improve the health and nutrition status of women and children under age five: (1) promoting behavior change and community mobilization to take appropriate responsibility for health; and (2)) building District Health Office (DHO) capacity to provide sustainable, quality service delivery at the facility and community levels. &nbsp;Educating health workers and caregivers about early childhood development (ECD) and simple actions they can take daily to support their infants was integrated as a key strategy. &nbsp;Quantitative data collected during the final survey showed a remarkable increase in key ECD indicators. &nbsp;After training in early childhood development, the percentage of mothers who played games which provided cognitive stimulation increased from 38% at baseline to 76% at final. &nbsp;The percentage of mothers who told a story, sang a song, or named objects for their child to encourage linguistic learning increased from 23% to 78% and the percentage of mothers who helped their child walk, massaged them, or played a game to challenge physical development increased from 63% to 84%. &nbsp;Also, integrating early childhood development with child survival interventions in Lira District led to improvements in parent-child relationships and has encouraged caregivers to spend greater and more meaningful time with children reading, singing, and playing games that encourage physical, cognitive and language development. &nbsp;Community members also report it has facilitated better relationships between spouses by helping parents better understand and interact with their children, which seems to be a contributing factor to reducing household violence. &nbsp;(Excerpts, modified)","'Educating community health workers, caregivers, and health providers regarding maternal child health and early childhood development in a post-conflict environment' ~|~_©_~|~ USAID cooperative agreement no. also listed in document as GHS-A-00-09-00012 ~|~_©_~|~ Submitted as: Final evaluation report : Lira child survival project ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Child survival and health grants program (CSHGP) ~|~_©_~|~ Mid-term evaluation: PD-ACT-420",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,GSH-A-00-09-00012-00,,12/1/2013 0:00,,Case management ~|~_©_~|~ Child health care ~|~_©_~|~ Child malnutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Dance ~|~_©_~|~ Health care costs ~|~_©_~|~ Infant nutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Mothers,Uganda,GSH-A-00-09-00012-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PBAAA337.pdf,4304 KB,012966 - Medical Teams International (MTI),,,English,application/pdf,,,"Sue Leonard ~|~_©_~|~ Carruth, Mary Helen ~|~_©_~|~ et al.",Child survival,1-Dec-13,,,,Final evaluation report : Lira District child survival project in Uganda,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTgxMjQz,Uganda,,,2013-12-01,2013,UGA,UGA_2013,0.40459464727042793,0.330139770999565,0.7189132706374091,0.605665365421615,,0.444444444444444,0.442650903717176,0.189179889047217,0.40162781290147404,,0.31555051078320095,,,0.41198701601672605,0.7095521615324879,0.203703703703704,,UGA,2013,2.0,0.49596142589043507,3.0,0.38545748100332444,TZA_2016,MOZ_2017,NGA_2015,NGA_2013,MLI_2016
PA-00J-JSF,"In August, 2013 the Promoting Long-Term Sustainability of Parque Nacional Cordillera Azul project finishes its operations after 5 years of implementation, including its original period and two extensions1 under an award from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID.) In this period, the award adds up to almost $5 million in support to the project. USAID/Peru has commissioned this evaluation to assess the effectiveness of the Parque Nacional Cordillera Azul (PNCAZ) project in achieving its objectives over the last 5 years. USAID/Peru is also interested in learning from the process and identifying factors that may have contributed to the project&rsquo;s success or failure. Thus, the evaluation responds to three main objectives: (1) to document the implementation process; (2) to learn to what extend the project&rsquo;s expected results have been achieved; and (3) to identify lessons learned from this experience that may be applicable to similar parks or projects. The evaluation's statement of work (SOW) established three evaluation questions that guide the analysis presented in this report: (1) was the Parque Nacional Cordillera Azul effectively protected; (2) has the project contributed to the long-term sustainability of the Park and its management; and (3) what are the key elements of this project that can be replicated in future initiatives to preserve biodiversity and avoid CO2 emissions.

PA-00J-JRR,"The USAID AFFORD Project is funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development and began as a five-year (2005-2010) health marketing initiative led by John Hopkins University Center for Communications in partnership with other organizations. &nbsp;In 2010, USAID/Uganda awarded a three year $18.5 million follow-on Assistance agreement (AFFORD) and an additional one year extension (2011-2014), to Johns Hopkins University (JHU). &nbsp;This second phase has been led by Johns Hopkins University Center for Communications Programs (JHUCCP) in partnership with Uganda Health Marketing Group (UHMG) with a mission to integrate health communication and social marketing techniques to address a variety of health issues and behaviors in Uganda, and an overarching aim of strengthening the institution of UHMG from an organization primarily dependent upon USAID funding to a private sector institution that is self-financing, self-governing and meeting its goal of contributing to the improved health status of Ugandans through Social Marketing. &nbsp;AFFORD objectives have been to: (1) further develop UHMG systems and capacity to support technical, financial, institutional and market sustainability; (2) increase accessibility and affordability of HIV/AIDS, Reproductive Health, Child Survival and malaria products and services for Ugandans using innovative private sector approaches; (3) increase knowledge and promote healthy behaviors and lifestyles among the general population and among targeted hard-to-reach and high-risk population segments. &nbsp;The primary purpose of this evaluation was to determine the extent to which UHMG's capacity as an indigenous organization promoting social marketing has been built and how it has played a key role in improving the uptake of healthy behaviors and increasing demand for delivery of health and HIV/AIDS services in Uganda. &nbsp;The evaluation was designed to inform ongoing and future social marketing activities by UHMG and other social marketing organizations in Uganda. &nbsp;The evaluation report is intended to provide ""lessons learned"" on strengthening local capacity as presented under the 2010 USAID Forward reforms. &nbsp;Questions the evaluation addresses are: (1) did AFFORD increase accessibility and affordability of HIV/AIDS, Reproductive Health, Child Survival and malaria products and services for Ugandans; (2) how relevant and effective have AFFORD's social marketing campaigns been in increasing awareness and uptake of health services; (3) what specifically is AFFORD's contribution to the delivery of health and HIV/AIDS services in Uganda; and (4) to what extent did AFFORD strengthen UHMG systems and capacity for technical, financial, institutional and market sustainability. &nbsp;(Excpert, modified)",Cover title: Performance evaluation of USAID/Uganda AFFORD : health marketing initiative project evaluation : improving the lives of Ugandans ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: AFFORD II ~|~_©_~|~ Mid-term evaluation: PD-ACR-190,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,,,9/1/2013 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Condoms ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Family health care ~|~_©_~|~ Family planning behavior ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Social marketing ~|~_©_~|~ Youth,Uganda,617-A-00-05-00011-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00JJRR.pdf,1373 KB,,,008618 - USAID.

PB-AAA-333,"This final performance evaluation of the Integrated Protected Areas Co-management (IPAC) Project focuses exclusively on the democracy and governance (DG) components of the project and assesses the effectiveness of these components in achieving the project's objectives. &nbsp;The evaluation is structured around ten evaluation questions and six DG project indicators relating to the enabling policy and legal framework; community participation and local organizations; capacity building; and communication and outreach. &nbsp;Additional evaluation questions addressed cross-cutting themes of gender and youth engagement; project coordination with stakeholders; project contributions to environmental governance; best practices; sustainable interventions; and project management. &nbsp;Data collection involved a review of project documents and supporting literature, semi-structured interviews with a wide range of stakeholders (from beneficiaries to Ministry staff), and visits to eight of the 25 protected areas in three of the project&lsquo;s five geographic clusters. &nbsp;Political disturbances made field work difficult to schedule, and it was not possible to interview all key stakeholders or make all planned field site visits. &nbsp;Overall, the evaluation concludes that IPAC has been a well-managed project that has done some high quality and well-documented work, met most of its DG targets, and contributed to its overall objectives in a very challenging context. &nbsp;IPAC can be particularly credited with what one observer called an ""unprecedented level of coordination"" with the three departments, helping them break out of their management silos and work together on biodiversity conservation issues. &nbsp;A national strategy and action plan for the PA system was developed and approved by the three departments. &nbsp;Many elements of the legal framework needed for PACM are now in place or in well-advanced preparation. &nbsp;Many stakeholders at all levels have received training on a variety of relevant topics. &nbsp;The co-managed PA system has now reached 25 sites involving 55 co-management organizations (CMOs) and nearly 1,000 participating village groups. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","Footer title: Final performance evaluation of the integrated protected areas co-management (IPAC) project ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order title: Integrated protected areas co-management (IPAC) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Prosperity, livelihoods and conserving ecosystems indefinite quantity contract (PLACE IQC) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Democracy and governance analytical services III",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-388-TO-12-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-10-00003,,9/1/2013 0:00,,Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Democracy ~|~_©_~|~ Protected area managers ~|~_©_~|~ Integrated management ~|~_©_~|~ Aquatic resource management ~|~_©_~|~ Biological diversity ~|~_©_~|~ Local level ~|~_©_~|~ Natural resource conservation,Bangladesh,EPP-I-01-06-00007-00 ~|~_©_~|~ EPP-I-00-06-00007-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PBAAA333.pdf,1253 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,"008511 - USAID.

(4) what were the key challenges to the project?; and (5) what are the prospects for sustainability of the end results produced and how effective was the program in building the capacity of Nepali organizations. &nbsp;The evaluation study shows that the EIG program approach was innovative; it linked basic literacy with life skills and agricultural entrepreneurship and productivity leading to employment and income generation. &nbsp;Vocational training program was unique as it entailed training providers to find employment for trainees unlike other general trainings. &nbsp;Furthermore EIG program leveraged resources (about $1.4 million) for infrastructure and capacity building activities. &nbsp;The program was integrated; it initially provided basic literacy and numeracy skills to disadvantaged farmers, arranged services and resources to increase agricultural productivity and promoted marketing of products for income generation. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",SOL-367-12-000010 ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Education for income generation (EIG),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,,,11/1/2013 0:00,,Agricultural occupations ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural production ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural technology ~|~_©_~|~ Business enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Income ~|~_©_~|~ Literacy ~|~_©_~|~ Youth,Nepal,367-C-00-08-00013-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-367-C-00-08-00013,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PBAAA002.pdf,1042 KB,"040720 - Population, Health and Development Group (PHDG)",,008583 - USAID.

PD-ACY-476,"In 2009, recognizing the need to strengthen sub-national governance and its institutions, primarily the Provincial Governors (PGs) and the Provincial Governors' Offices (PGOs), USAID/Afghanistan's Office of Democracy and Governance (ODG) designed the Performance Based Governance Fund (PBGF) project.&nbsp; The purpose of PBGF is to deliver capacity building and financial support to PGs and their offices to enable them to fulfill their key functions as the provincial representatives of the national government and to provide essential services to their respective constituents.&nbsp; The implementing partner for PBGF is The Asia Foundation (TAF).&nbsp; The PBGF project has been implemented in two phases.&nbsp; Phase I (PBGF-I) was co-funded from 2009 - 2011 by USAID, the United Kingdom's Department of International Development (DFID), and the Government of Belgium.&nbsp; Phase II (PBGF-II) was funded solely by USAID and is scheduled to end in 2013.&nbsp; The purpose of this evaluation was to assess the performance of PBGF and TAF in building the capacity of the PGOs to plan, budget, and procure goods and services to respond to the needs of citizens.&nbsp; The evaluation was also called upon to assess the project's capacity to improve the legitimacy and popular perception of the PGOs by examining the quality of interventions and support to different actors in the provincial governance framework.&nbsp; As a final evaluation, the purpose is also to identify lessons that can inform future USAID support to PGOs through similar programs.&nbsp; The evaluation found, despite functioning in areas of the country that are increasingly difficult to monitor and manage, that TAF implemented a well-managed and responsive program that made progress toward its stated goals.&nbsp; The majority of responses received from PGs, PGO staff, line ministries, and beneficiaries regarding PBGF were positive with respect to program management and the financial assistance provided, and the program provided an important benefit to communities by funding grants to community groups identified by PGOs.&nbsp; The evaluation concludes that: (1) that overall, PBGF demonstrated that it is possible to support and build the institutional capacity of PGOs by providing resources, training and mentoring to help them improve and fulfill their outreach and responsiveness to citizens' needs; (2) changes that PBGF introduced in the allocation of spending did appear to have led to improved outreach to outlying districts; (3) a key strength of the program was the reliability with which funds were delivered to PGOs each month, coupled with the incentives PBGF introduced; (4) the incentive system could have been improved by inviting PGOs to participate in its design and provide inputs on various aspects; and (5) capacity building in financial management was an area of the project with little success.&nbsp; Recommendations include: (1) greater attention must be given to developing a Provincial Development Plan that is within the budget capacities of GIRoA; (2) PGOs should be more aware of the various central line ministry funding ceilings before planning development activities; (3) it is recommended that PBGF and PGOs, given the importance of having a visible presence in outlying districts to citizens' perceptions of the PGO and GIRoA, establish a dedicated fund to provide development assistance and services to outlying districts; (4) the design of future projects would also benefit from measuring how much outreach is occurring within each outreach category, who the beneficiaries are, how often outreach is occurring, the costs of outreach activities, the number of districts receiving outreach, and the number of people benefiting on a monthly basis; and (5) building on the positive experiences reported by DoWA representatives and the importance of PBGF funding to DoWA programs, it is recommended that a District Women's Initiative Support program be promoted through the PGOs.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Evaluated project title: Performance-based governance fund project (PBGF ) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Services under program and project offices for results tracking II (SUPPORT II),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-306-C-12-00012,,9/1/2013 0:00,,Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Provinces ~|~_©_~|~ Representative democracy ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Budgeting ~|~_©_~|~ Procurement ~|~_©_~|~ Civil service ~|~_©_~|~ Financial resources ~|~_©_~|~ Regulations,Afghanistan,306-A-00-09-00531-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-306-A-00-09-00531,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACY476.pdf,1663 KB,"000356 - Checchi and Co.

(MKFI) in achieving LIPAD's objectives of: (1) enhanced peace initiatives through literacy activities (with special attention to women nonliterates who could be effective peace agents and agents of change); (2) increased basic literacy and functional literacy of citizens in the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao (ARMM); and (3) developed sensitivity of youth to peace and development efforts in the ARMM by harnessing their services in the literacy delivery program. &nbsp;The evaluation team examined the effectiveness of LIPAD service delivery chain within four major activities&mdash;adult literacy facilitator training, adult literacy classes, learning materials distribution, and the integration of peace building concepts in the adult literacy curriculum. &nbsp;The team also assessed project results guided by 11 evaluation questions clustered within the following five domains: for relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, sustainability, and other essentials (e.g., monitoring and evaluation, and outreach communications) and documented what is working/good practices. &nbsp;The evaluation assessed the degree to which these results or other unintended project outcomes are supported and owned by stakeholders at the local and municipal levels and made recommendations on what could be better where applicable. &nbsp;It is anticipated the the findings from this performance evaluation will be used to inform the staff of the USAID/Philippines (Offices of Education and Program Resources Management) as well as the staff of MKFI and the Government of the Philippines stakeholders (Department of Education [Central and ARMM] and the Department of Social Work and Development) on what's working and what could be better in implementing similar types of literacy projects. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",Cover title: AID-492-E-13-00003/AID-492-BC-13-00025 'literacy for peace and development (LIPAD) project performance evaluation : final publishable report ~|~_©_~|~ Header title: USAID AID-492-E-13-00003/AID-492-BC-13-00025 'literacy for peace and development (LIPAD) project performance evaluation : final report ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Literacy for peace and development' (LIPAD),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-492-E-13-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-492-BC-13-00025,,10/1/2013 0:00,,Adults ~|~_©_~|~ Children ~|~_©_~|~ Dance ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Food ~|~_©_~|~ Literacy ~|~_©_~|~ Mass media ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion,Philippines,AID-492-A-11-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACY456.pdf,12556 KB,"040710 - CPRM Consultants, Inc.",,008592 - USAID.

(IBTCI) was contracted to perform the final performance evaluation of USAID/East Africa's (USAID/EA) Peace in East and Central Africa II (PEACE II) program. &nbsp;The five-year PEACE II program was USAID/EA's primary conflict mitigation activity in terms of financial investment and profile, and operated from 2007-2012. &nbsp;The Cooperative Agreement (CoAg) was awarded to PACT in September 30, 2007 and the program ended on December 31, 2012, and was managed by the USAID Regional Conflict Management and Governance Office (RCMG). &nbsp;PEACE II program activities were active in multiple peace corridors along the Kenya-Somalia border and in one corridor on the Kenya-Uganda border. &nbsp;In the context of PEACE II, peace corridors are considered discrete geographic zones with notable historical cross-border activity, as well as evidence of cross-border or inter-clan conflict. &nbsp;Most peace corridors consist of two townships, one on either side of the targeted border. &nbsp;This is an evidence-based evaluation that investigates the effectiveness of PEACE II in: (1) building community conflict prevention, mitigation, and response capacity; and (2) improving security in targeted communities. &nbsp;The evaluation also supported USAID/EA to learn which theories of change (ToCs) proved valid, which ones did not, and, where monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) data was not sufficient, to make a validity determination. &nbsp;Based on the evidence, the PEACE II projects and activities were largely successful as mechanisms to facilitate peacebuilding, trauma healing, social reconciliation, peace networking and cross-border interaction and collaboration between communities. &nbsp;They successfully leveraged existing community peace mechanisms such as the Peace Committees, elders, womens and youth groups, traditional and culture-specific trauma healing and training mechanisms, and response networks to build additional and enhanced capacities for change in the corridors. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</span>","'This publication .... was prepared under Contract Number AID-RAN-I-00-09-00016, Task Order Number AID-623-TO-12-00002 ....' ~|~_©_~|~ Also known as: PEACE II end project performance evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Peace in East and Central Africa II (PEACE II)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-623-TO-12-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00016-00,,2/1/2013 0:00,,Behavior change ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Crimes ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Households ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion ~|~_©_~|~ Violence against women ~|~_©_~|~ Youth,Central Africa ~|~_©_~|~ East Africa,623-A-00-07-00050-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACW315.pdf,1192 KB,"001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

PD-ACU-718,"<span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"">This report is the final evaluation of USAID/Indonesias Decentralized Basic Education (DBE) program. &nbsp;The DBE program was the cornerstone of the United States assistance to education in Indonesia and was designed to directly respond to the Government of Indonesias priorities to decentralize and revitalize the education sector and focused on improving school management and governance and the quality and relevance of education in primary and junior secondary schools. &nbsp;The project was divided into three components: (1) assistance to local governments and communities to manage education services more effectively; (2) enhancement of teaching and learning to improve student performance, especially in key subjects such as math, science and reading; and (3) assurance that Indonesias youth gain more relevant life and work skills to better compete for jobs in the modern economy. &nbsp;The purpose of this evaluation is to assist USAID/Indonesia in the assessment of the impact of the three DBE programs on the quality and relevance of primary and junior secondary education in Indonesia. &nbsp;More specifically, the evaluation assessed: (1) how successful the three DBE programs were in achieving the primary goals; (2) the degree to which these goals have been met; and (3) the contributing factors that were responsible for or detracted from the achievement of these goals. &nbsp;In addition, USAID/Indonesia asked the evaluators to highlight any lessons learned or best practices from the implementation of the DBE program that could be applied to a recently-awarded new basic education program, Prioritizing Reform, Innovation, Opportunities for Reaching Indonesia's Teachers, Administrators, and Students (PRIORITAS). &nbsp;The evaluation concluded that all three DBE projects (DBE1, DBE2, DBE3) were aimed at addressing systematic weaknesses in the Indonesian education system. &nbsp;In each case, the DBE projects introduced important concepts and made significant in-roads toward improving school and district management and governance and teaching and learning outcomes in primary and secondary schools in Indonesia. &nbsp;Moreover, bringing education reforms to scale is incredibly difficult under the best of circumstances. &nbsp;Nevertheless, in the case of DBE, the ""glass is half-full"" and rapidly shrinking. &nbsp;When compared to the standard conventional Indonesian school, DBE schools are significantly better and the schools are better managed with greater community involvement, better teaching methods evident, and more enthusiastic teachers and students apparent. &nbsp;However, when compared to outstanding schools using active learning pedagogy, most of the DBE-partner schools were lack-luster with weak, inconsistent active learning methods being applied. &nbsp;In some schools, the program appears to be fading quickly. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</span>",Title in footer: Indonesia : decentralized basic education final evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Decentralized basic education (DBE) ~|~_©_~|~ Task Order 46 ~|~_©_~|~ Task order title: Global evaluation and monitoring II (GEM II) ~|~_©_~|~ V. 2 (annexes): PD-ACU-719,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,EDH-E-00-08-00003-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-EDH-E-00-08-00003,,11/1/2012 0:00,,Districts ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Education ~|~_©_~|~ Management ~|~_©_~|~ Students ~|~_©_~|~ Teachers ~|~_©_~|~ Training,Indonesia,497-M-00-05-00029-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-497-M-00-05-00029,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU718.pdf,1104 KB,"013070 - JBS International, Inc.

PD-ACU-710,"<span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"">The United States Agency for International Development's (USAID) Growth with Equity in Mindanao III (GEM-3) is a five-year (2008 to 2012), $99 million dollar program that operates throughout Mindanao, but is specifically targeted to promote development activities in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) and other conflict-affected areas of the region. &nbsp;GEM-3's principal objectives are to: (1) accelerate economic growth in Mindanao; (2) assure that as many people as possible participate in and benefit from the growth; and (3) bring about and consolidate peace in Mindanao. &nbsp;The purpose of this performance evaluation is to identify strengths and weaknesses in GEM-3, with the objective to assess key issues of impact, relevance, effectiveness, efficiency, gender, sustainability and lessons that can be learned from the program. &nbsp;Overall, the evaluators found that GEM-3 performance has been on track and will achieve all the physical targets laid out in the project documents by end of project life in December 2012. &nbsp;It is too early to assess the efficacy of the program but it is trending as follows: (1) the first objective (economic growth) is partially achieved, as GEM-3 has facilitated and laid the foundation for economic growth in Mindanao; (2) the second (insure participation) has been achieved, especially for rural residents, who have benefited from infrastructure projects; and (3) the third objective (bring peace) is more difficult to assess without pre and post project data. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</span>",Annexes volume has been appended ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Growth with equity in Mindanao III (GEM-3),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-492-C-12-00007,,11/1/2012 0:00,,Economic growth ~|~_©_~|~ Equity ~|~_©_~|~ Peace ~|~_©_~|~ Economic infrastructure ~|~_©_~|~ Labor force ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Economic and social reintegration ~|~_©_~|~ Public relations,Philippines,492-C-00-08-00001-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 492-C-00-02-00018-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU710.pdf,5559 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008592 - USAID.

PD-ACU-559,"<p>The Arid and Marginal Lands Recovery Consortium (ARC) Program in Kenya was a three-year program that ran from 2009-2012, in response to the drought of 2008/9 and the resulting food crisis in Kenya.&nbsp; The goal of the project was to sustain access to food in vulnerable rural communities through enhanced resilience to shocks.&nbsp; The specific objectives of the program were to increase agricultural productivity, to protect and diversify household (HH) asset bases, and to strengthen livelihood options to increase HH purchasing power.&nbsp; The evaluators found that the program beneficiaries across the ARC project area repeatedly expressed confidence that ARC area HHs had improved their ability to cope in times of severe stress as compared to 2009.&nbsp; More specifically, the evaluation outlines the results to five questions: (1) appropriateness of the program; (2) program performance; (3) effectiveness; (4) gender equity; and (5) sustainability.&nbsp; The ARC program has generated important lessons: (1) strengthening of public (Government of Kenya)/private partnerships is an essential component for ensuring the sustainability of activities; (2) community involvement and partnerships are vital to the success of activities, such as community monitoring of livestock border movements and disease control through the Community Disease Control Committees (CDCCs); and (3) economic recovery and income generation activities such as the agro-vet store in Balambala and the tilapia farm in Kinnia proved to be the most attractive and sustainable among pastoralists and drop-outs.&nbsp; Overall recommendations call for the modification of pilot projects and incorporating lessons learned in order to ensure that future activities are scalable and replicable, both technically and financially: (1) build on program successes and achievements by further developing scalable activities from pilot interventions in livestock and alternative livelihoods into larger scale interventions across the target areas; (2) continue the development of alternative livelihoods as options for pastoralists to allow for asset diversification to help strengthen HH resiliency from future shocks; (3) continue the development of growth centers to provide alternative lifestyles and income generating options; and (4) allow time for interventions to produce results of critical mass in order to ensure the realization of impacts from these interventions.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)</p>","""Submitted to: USAID Kenya"" ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Arid and marginal lands recovery consortium (ARC)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-623-TO-11-00007 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00015 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00015-00,,10/1/2012 0:00,,Agriculture ~|~_©_~|~ Diseases ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Economics ~|~_©_~|~ Finance ~|~_©_~|~ Management ~|~_©_~|~ Nutrition,Kenya,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU559.pdf,775 KB,"011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

PD-ACY-106,"The intervention, referred to as house helps Health and Life skills project (HELP), was implemented in September 2009 to June 2010 in collaboration with interested faith-based organizations (FBOs) and involved raising awareness among congregants of the FBO and the surrounding community, as well as offering health and life skills training on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV and unintended pregnancy prevention to house girls. &nbsp;The girls were taken through a seven module curriculum covering: (1) self-esteem and communication skills; (2) sexual and reproductive health (SRH); (3) STIs including HIV prevention and protection; (4) sexual violence, alcohol and drug abuse; (5) personal savings and financial management; (6) basic household safety and security; and, (7) basic first aid. &nbsp;The overall goal of this evaluation was to describe the effect of the intervention on house girls' knowledge and practices as relates to HIV and unintended pregnancy prevention. &nbsp;Specifically, the objectives were: (1) to examine house girls' sources of vulnerability to STIs including HIV and unintended pregnancy, their post training knowledge of these subjects, and their sexual and reproductive health behaviors; (2) to describe house girls' capacity to take risk-reduction action on STIs including HIV and unintended pregnancies; (3) to descriptively compare the outcomes of the intervention in areas characterized by differences in the socioeconomic status of the population; and (4) to determine perceptions and attitudes towards the program by the house girls, their employers and church members. &nbsp;Overall, the study has demonstrated that the training provided an opportunity for the house girls to receive information that otherwise proved elusive to them given the nature of their work. &nbsp;Improved self-esteem and efficacy and the increased financial management realized among the house girls have been directly attributed to their participation in the project by the house girls themselves, their employers and by the church members interviewed. &nbsp;Increased knowledge on STIs (including HIV prevention) and prevention of unintended pregnancies was realized. &nbsp;After the training the house girls said that their communication skills improved, they had better appreciation of their work and they were more confident. &nbsp;These same observations were made by the employers and church members as well. &nbsp;Reservations about the training as expressed by the employers included fear that the house girls would leave once trained and the time spent by the house girls during training. &nbsp;All in all, employers, church members and the house girls would recommend the project to others. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",Evaluated project title: Health and life skills project (HELP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Project title: Contraceptive and reproductive health technology research and utilization (CRTU) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Preventive technologies agreement (PTA),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,GPO-A-00-05-00022-00 ~|~_©_~|~ GHO-A-00-09-00016-00,,1/1/2013 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Condoms ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Family health care ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Girls ~|~_©_~|~ Houses ~|~_©_~|~ Pregnancy,Kenya,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACY106.pdf,702 KB,009154 - Family Health International (FHI),,013626 - U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) ~|~_©_~|~ 011262 - USAID.

PD-ACY-083,"The increasing importance of the wildlife management areas (WMAs) in Tanzania, where 17 WMAs are now functioning and 22 others are in various stages of development, begs the question of what successes have been achieved and what challenges remain to be addressed if this Community-Based Conservation model is to be sustained and even scaled up. &nbsp;There has not been a country-wide evaluation of WMAs since the pilot-phase evaluation in 2007 at a time when most WMAs were too new to yield firm projections for the long term. &nbsp;The evaluation team chose five of the nine pilot WMAs for which full baseline studies were available: Wami-Mbiki, Pawaga-Idodi, Ipole, Burunge, and Enduimet. &nbsp;All five had been officially launched in 2003 and all had reached fully registered status with user rights by 2007. &nbsp;The four-person evaluation team spent approximately four weeks in the field visiting 15 villages around these five WMAs, at the same time that a 750-person household survey was carried out in 25 villages in the same WMAs. &nbsp;The evaluation had three objectives: (1) assess what have been the key outcomes and achievements of the overall WMA approach for the Tanzanian government, local communities, and conservation of wildlife and other resources in terms of creating increased financial benefits, strengthening governance, improving human-wildlife conflicts, and strengthening wildlife management; (2) Identify whether the policy framework and the WMA institutional structure is effective and sufficient in meeting the overall WMA goal of providing benefits to both communities and wildlife; and (3) identify what opportunities and challenges exist to the sustainability and scaling up of the current approach. &nbsp;The review found that WMAs in Tanzania are presently at a key inflection point in their evolution, with a number of possible future pathways of development. &nbsp;Considerable progress has been made during the past decade in terms of: (1) creating a basic legal and institutional framework for WMAs; (2) supporting communities to establish the basic management structures and land use patterns required to form and oversee WMAs; and (3) building broad support for WMAs as a key component of both conservation and natural resource-related development policies and approaches in Tanzania. &nbsp;However, despite this significant progress, major challenges remain, particularly in the economic and governance realms. &nbsp;New approaches to organizational development of authorized associations (AAs), enterprise development and private sector engagement in WMAs, and larger-scale wildlife sector governance issues will be an important element of continuing support by USAID to WMAs, and create numerous opportunities for future support to be designed in a more strategic way. &nbsp;The recommendations highlight these opportunities and suggest specific steps for developing them. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",Cover title: Tanzania wildlife management areas evaluation : final evaluation report ~|~_©_~|~ Footer title: Tanzania WMA evaluation : final evaluation report ~|~_©_~|~ Submitted as: Tanzania wildlife management evaluation,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,,,7/1/2013 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural production ~|~_©_~|~ Business enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Households ~|~_©_~|~ Livestock ~|~_©_~|~ Villages,Tanzania,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACY083.pdf,1616 KB,013576 - Tetra Tech ARD ~|~_©_~|~ 040876 - Maliasili Initiatives,,008612 - USAID.

PD-ACX-654,"In 2005, Hospice Africa Uganda (HAU) signed a cooperative agreement with USAID Uganda. &nbsp;The program was entitled ""Expanding the access to and scope of Palliative Care for People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLHIV) and their families"". &nbsp;The overall objective of the program was to increase access to and utilization of quality palliative care service by PLHIV's and their immediate families. &nbsp;Aims of the Palliative Care Program were: (1) improving access to holistic Palliative Care for PLHA's and their immediate families; (2) strengthening specialist palliative care competencies within the public, private, faith based and civil society HIV/AIDS service providers; and (3) influencing national policy to reposition pain, symptoms management and end of life care within the overall health and HIV/AIDS care delivery. &nbsp;The purpose of the evaluation was to present an independent opinion on the impact of expanding coverage and access of Palliative Care services (PC) through the Hospice Africa Uganda program over the last 5 years. &nbsp;The evaluation was also intended to document lessons learned and best practices developed from the implemented program. &nbsp;The key evaluation questions included: (1) HAU has training care providers as one of its major approaches--were the trainings delivered effectively and efficiently; (2) how well has HAU design and structure addressed factors facilitating or hindering palliative care giving [and] what was the value-addition of HAU sub-partners; (3) analyze the relevance of palliative care in the era of expanding access to Anti Retroviral Therapy (ART); (4) how effective has HAU been in influencing national policy and practice on palliative care; (5) what is the likelihood that this program will be successful [and] given the rate of achievement of results and current approaches and activities, assess the prospect that this project will achieve all its intended results; (6) how sustainable are HAU activities and results[and] suggest modifications to increase sustainability; and (7) what are the lessons Learned and best practices? &nbsp;The evaluation team concludes the following: (1) the HAU program is most likely to be successful; however, certain elements of holistic PC services like psycho-social and spiritual care delivery need to be strengthened; (2) HAU trainings effectively and efficiently transferred specialized PC skills [and] Implementing Partners (IPs) now must take this forward, integrating PC in AIDS care and treatment, and rolling out trainings through Continuous Medical Education (CMEs); (3) the 2009-2013 program design and structure satisfactorily addressed the hindrances identified at end-phase 1 evaluation, and leveraged the facilitating factors [and] emerging hindrances were identified mostly at facility/district level; (4) PC remains relevant even with expanding ART [and] PLHIV on ART suffer pains, psychosocial and spiritual needs, yet for Uganda, less than 10% of PLHIV in need have accessed PC; (5) although the policy influence targets were satisfactorily achieved, the short term outcomes are not yet translated into budget allocations for PC activities and they remain unknown at district and facility levels; and (6) the HAU PC program has established several structures for sustainability, though considered to be at infancy. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)",Title in footer: End of program evaluation : PC HAU 2009-2013,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,617-A-00-05-00010-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 617-A00-05-00010-00,,2/1/2013 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Health facilities ~|~_©_~|~ Health workers ~|~_©_~|~ Hospitals ~|~_©_~|~ Military ~|~_©_~|~ Nurses ~|~_©_~|~ Trainees,Uganda,617-A-00-05-00010-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX654.pdf,733 KB,040195 - Multiple Management Consult (MMC),,008618 - USAID.

PD-ACX-662,"<div>Humana People to People responded to the epidemic in South Africa by creating the Total Control of the Epidemic (TCE) program in 2000. &nbsp;The TCE program is a grassroots one-on-one communication and mobilization program that has run since 2002 with the aim of reaching every person in a community with information, education, and HIV/AIDS counselling and testing. &nbsp;The aim of creating TCE was to mobilize people for action, so that they could take control of HIV &amp; AIDS and help each other to deal with the consequences of the epidemic. &nbsp;The ultimate goal of the TCE program is to contribute to the reduction in the incidence of HIV infections. &nbsp;The anticipated outcomes of the TCE program are articulated in terms of changes in knowledge, attitudes, behaviours and skills. &nbsp;These include: (1) changed attitudes and behaviour of community members and members of most at risk groups, manifest as community members consistently use HIV prevention services, community members have undertaken HCT and know their HIV status, community members avoid risky sexual behaviour and use condoms correctly and consistently, and community members no longer discriminate against People Living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA); (2) increased knowledge around HIV transmission and HIV and AIDS prevention and treatment; (3) the capacity of local leaders built regarding HIV and AIDS prevention, care and support and stigma reduction; and (4) local leaders develop facilitation and counselling skills. &nbsp;The evaluation sets out to assess: (1) the extent to which the TCE program led to changes in knowledge, attitudes and behaviour with regards to the HIV and AIDS epidemic, as well as the extent to which Humana TCE is responsible for measured effects in a multi-intervention environment; (2) whether the capacity of local leaders has been built to facilitate HIV and AIDS prevention in their communities; and (3) what additional impacts, both positive and detrimental, that may be attributed to the Humana TCE programe. &nbsp;Humana TCE is undoubtedly effective in increasing knowledge about HIV and AIDS, improving attitudes of personal responsibility, and significantly improving health seeking behaviours amongst beneficiaries. &nbsp;It achieves these results through a robust theory of change, program design that relies on innovative behaviour change and monitoring mechanisms, and a compelling message of assuming personal responsibility for your behaviour, your status, your health and that of other members in your community. &nbsp;However, despite this apparently comprehensive program design and strong effects on every other measure, the key objective of changing sexual behaviour is elusive. &nbsp;Perceptions of the effectiveness of Humana TCE are at risk of being undermined by an inconsistent system for registering households reached. &nbsp;Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each assessment objective. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</div> <div></div>","""Comissioned by PactSouth Africa under Associate Award No. 027A0070"" ~|~_©_~|~ Title in footer: Humana TCE Programme evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Submitted as: Evaluation of the humana total control of the epidemic (TCE) programme in Mpumalanga and Limpopo",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,674-A-00-08-00001-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-674-A-00-08-00001,,4/1/2013 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Condoms ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Feedback ~|~_©_~|~ Households ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion,South Africa,674-A-00-08-00001-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-674-A-00-08-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX662.pdf,1697 KB,"040526 - Feedback Research and Analytics (FeedbackRA) ~|~_©_~|~ 013495 - Pact, Inc.",,013626 - U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) ~|~_©_~|~ 008605 - USAID.

PD-ACX-375,"This is a report of a performance evaluation of the Support to Sub-national Governance Structures (SNG) project implemented by the National Democratic Institute (NDI or the Institute), which has been working in Afghanistan since 2002.&nbsp; The SNG project began in June, 2008; USAID funding was on the basis of a Cooperative Agreement that was signed with NDI, with two major modifications in March 2011 and July 2012.&nbsp; The 14-month extension described in the latter modification ends in September 2013.&nbsp; This was the first evaluation of this project, and its Statement of Work had two main objectives: to assess NDI's performance in supporting the operations of Provincial Councils (PCs) across Afghanistan, and to provide information that USAID can use to decide how best to support subnational governance after this project ends in 2013.&nbsp; This was essentially a dual performance evaluation, in that it assessed the effectiveness of NDI's support for the PCs, which in turn required assessment of how the PCs were working in their provinces.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Title in footer: Performance evaluation of support to sub-national governance structures (SNG) project ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Support to sub-national governance structures (SNG) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Services under program and project offices for results tracking II (SUPPORT II),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-306-C-12-00012,,2/1/2013 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Parliamentary systems ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Transparency ~|~_©_~|~ Violence against women ~|~_©_~|~ Voting ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Afghanistan,306-A-00-08-00513-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX375.pdf,1482 KB,"000356 - Checchi and Co.

PD-ACX-327,"The devastating earthquake of January 2010 has increased the risks of food insecurity within poor rural households in the Grande-Anse department of Haiti. &nbsp;In November 2010, Hurricane Thomas worsened the vulnerability of the Grande-Anse population by destroying assets from agriculture and fishing in the department. In the commune of Moron, households reporting losing 90 % of agricultural goods. &nbsp;Those two events combined forced populations living with less than $1 a day to allocate more than 60% of its income to food. &nbsp;Soon after, a cholera epidemic broke out in Haiti, with the heaviest number of cases reported in the Grande-Anse. &nbsp;Studies revealed that the hurricane and cholera outbreak, along with rising food prices, greatly increased family vulnerability. &nbsp;In addition, an increased number of orphans augmented the risks of health issues for children including malnutrition. &nbsp;To tackle the aforementioned problem, CARE submitted a proposal to USAID/Food for Peace addressing food insecurity concerns for populations in nine communes of the Grande-Anse department. &nbsp;Approved by USAID, this project named ""Electronic Food Voucher program &ndash; Kore L'avni Nou"", aimed to support 12,000 vulnerable families (72,000 individuals) with a $50 (2,000 HTG) monthly voucher over a six month period. &nbsp;In addition, 68 local shops were approved to supply beneficiaries with the following key commodities: rice, vegetable oil, maize and beans, forming a minimum food basket and required kilocalories per family per month. &nbsp;The goals of this evaluation were: (1) identify and evaluate program outcomes, intended and unintended, positive or negative and impact on beneficiaries versus non-beneficiaries; (2) overview data collected on a regular basis and present performance monitoring (strengths, weaknesses), triangulate with final evaluation collected data for better understanding; (3) determine the adequacy of program design to meet the identified needs in the target area; (4) compare final conditions with baseline findings and present persisting gaps in coping strategies used by the households to mitigate vulnerability; (5) relate lessons learned to appropriate stakeholders; (6) identify key obstacles preventing a correct program execution; and (7) identify key successes and recommendations for future consideration. &nbsp;Specific evaluation findings, conclusions and recommendations are provided with detailed analysis for each evaluation goal. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)","""Submitted to CARE Haiti""",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,,,2/1/2013 0:00,,Food aid programs ~|~_©_~|~ Vouchers ~|~_©_~|~ Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Households ~|~_©_~|~ Beneficiary participation ~|~_©_~|~ Finance ~|~_©_~|~ Telephones ~|~_©_~|~ Access to education ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Commodities,Haiti,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX327.pdf,2200 KB,040505 - Diagnostic & Development Group (DDG) ~|~_©_~|~ 010850 - CARE USA,,000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID),English,application/pdf,,,"Pierreval, Isnel ~|~_©_~|~ Zephyr, Luckny ~|~_©_~|~ Lachaud, James",Food aid programs,Feb-13,,,,Final evaluation of the project Kore L'Avni Nou food voucher programme implemented by CARE in the Department of Grande-Anse,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTcwMDUy,Haiti,,,2013-02-01,2013,HTI,HTI_2013,0.07114739499575701,0.46572937914589396,0.8192267502612328,,,0.222222222222222,,0.16293998471965698,0.192034072830708,,0.278093076049943,,,0.637392940281218,0.404090085425835,0.21296296296296302,,HTI,2013,3.0,0.24388819467343928,4.0,0.41504768170027867,MRT_2018,PAK_2015,PAK_2014,EGY_2017,IRQ_2018

PD-ACW-317,"<span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"">USAID awarded a five-year local field support cooperative agreement to Pact Inc. (690-A-00-07-00104-00) on September 26, 2007, with a planned life of project of US$40 million through the PEPFAR. &nbsp;The goal of the Pact program, Community Rapid and Effective Action Combating HIV/AIDS (REACH) Namibia program was to scale up and sustain a comprehensive response to HIV/AIDS services (including prevention, care, and support for orphans and vulnerable children) through Namibian and international sub-grantees. &nbsp;The program was guided by six key program objectives through October 2010. &nbsp;In November 2010, following a mid-term evaluation, USAID entered into a modification of assistance agreement with Pact Inc. to realign its program to the Government of Namibia and PEPFAR phase II priorities. &nbsp;The emphasis shifted from a focus on the emergency scale-up approach of PEPFAR I to the Pact ""Strengthening the Capacity for Country Ownership (SCCO)"" programmatic themes of country ownership, long-term sustainability, and systems strengthening. &nbsp;This end-of-project report evaluates the final 19 months of the five year project and distinguishes accomplishment in this timeframe from previous accomplishments and activities. &nbsp;The focus of the report is on evaluating Pacts effectiveness towards strengthening the four directorates of the Ministry of Gender Equality and Child Welfare (MGECW) and six USAID-selected civil service organizations (CSOs). &nbsp;This report continues the USAID evaluation procedure whose last major effort was a mid-term evaluation report (January 2011). &nbsp;The evaluators conclude that Pact fulfilled all of its contractual obligations at a standard that is defined as satisfactory (i.e., fulfilling its contractual obligations under the award) that is supported by primary collection of evidence via document review and key informant interviews. &nbsp;This evaluation also identifies strengths and weaknesses as reported by both Pact advisors and Ministry and CSO partners. &nbsp;(Excerpt)</span>",Authoring organization unknown ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Community rapid and effective action combating HIV/AIDS (REACH) Namibia program ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title also known as: Community REACH Namibia program ~|~_©_~|~ Restricted ver.: PD-ACW-318,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,,,10/1/2012 0:00,,Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Education ~|~_©_~|~ Management ~|~_©_~|~ Mass media ~|~_©_~|~ Nutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Transportation ~|~_©_~|~ USAID,Namibia,690-A-00-07-00104-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACW317.pdf,2628 KB,,,008582 - USAID.

PD-ACW-279,"Kabeho Mwana (Life for a Child) was implemented from October 2006 to September 2011 as one of 16 USAID/Child Survival and Health Grants Program (CSHGP)-funded expanded impact projects (EIP) worldwide. It was designed to scale up community case management (CCM) of malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia, and to promote key community-level health promotion and disease prevention actions in Rwanda. Concern Worldwide was the lead agency, and implemented in partnership with the International Rescue Committee (IRC) and World Relief. The project covered six districts in Southern and Eastern Rwanda: Gisagara, Kirehe, Ngoma, Nyamagabe, Nyamasheke, and Nyaruguru, representing one-fifth of the districts of Rwanda and 18% of the countrys total population.The project objectives included:1) Increasing access to prompt first-line treatment for young children with malaria, diarrhea and pneumonia by expanding CCM, strengthening health service delivery systems, and establishing performance contracting for CHW supervision.2) Increasing coverage of key preventive interventions by improving targeting and increasing the breadth of preventive child health services through outreach.3) Increasing adoption of key family health practices through community mobilization and social behavior change.During these five years, the Government of Rwanda (GOR) built on initial efforts at decentralization (2005) to accelerate and nationally scale its community integrated management of childhood illnesses (c-IMCI) approach. Under the governance of the National Malaria Control Program (NMCP), independent efforts of the three NGO partners had already built a positive experience in Home-based Management of Malaria (HBM). As the GOR created the MOHs Community Health Desk (CHD), it established a national policy for integrated Community Case Management (CCM). This generated both high demands on Kabeho Mwana for flexibility, and a supportive environment for achieving results.","""Gisagara, Kirehe, Ngoma, Nyamagabe, Nyaraguru, and Nyamasheke Districts, Rwanda -- October 2006- September 2011"" ~|~_©_~|~ Title in footer: Kabeho mwana -- final evaluation",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,GHS-A-00-05-00018-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GHS-A-00-05-00018,,12/1/2011 0:00,,Child survival activities ~|~_©_~|~ Community development ~|~_©_~|~ Case management ~|~_©_~|~ Malaria ~|~_©_~|~ Diarrhea ~|~_©_~|~ Pneumonia ~|~_©_~|~ Community health care ~|~_©_~|~ Child care ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Adverse health practices ~|~_©_~|~ Community mobilization,Rwanda,GHS-A-00-05-00018-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GHS-A-00-05-00018,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACW279.pdf,1979 KB,013093 - ICF International ~|~_©_~|~ 010283 - Concern Worldwide,,"011222 - USAID.

PD-ACX-308,"This evaluation was undertaken to assess the performance of the Avian and Pandemic Influenza (API) Program, funded by USAID and implemented in Egypt between October 2007 and September 2011.&nbsp; The purpose of the evaluation was to: (1) review, analyze, and evaluate the effectiveness of USAID-funded API activities to date in achieving program objectives and completing deliverables; and (2) assess USAID/Egypt's contribution to improving API prevention and control.&nbsp; The task of the evaluation was to produce findings that would inform the direction of future USAID/Egypt API funding and become the basis from which to draft a scope of work (SOW) for a follow-on integrated API program.&nbsp; The evaluation addressed the following five questions: (1) to what extent has the API Program with its different components achieved the intended goals and results?; (2) to what extent were the monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) systems of the API Program, with its different components, effective for monitoring progress?; (3) to what extent were the technical components and approaches of the API Program effective in achieving the desired outcomes/impacts?; (4) to what extent were the management structures, administrative support, and partnerships effective?; and (5) what are the lessons learned, best practices, and the corresponding recommendations for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the API Program? The audience for the evaluation report was USAID/Egypt, specifically the Office of Health; USAID/Washington; and future implementing partners of API activities.&nbsp; The evaluation was also to provide feedback to each of the partners to help them understand both their strengths and areas where technical, administrative, and management efforts could be improved.&nbsp; In addition, Government of Egypt (GOE) counterparts would learn how to better benefit from implementing partner technical assistance (TA).&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Evaluated project title: Strengthening of avian influenza detection and response (SAIDR) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Communication for healthy living (CHL) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Avian influenza vaccine efficacy project (AIVEP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health technical assistance bridge II (GH tech bridge II),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-C-12-00027,,12/1/2012 0:00,,Influenza A (H5N1) (Avian flu) ~|~_©_~|~ Diseases ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Health ~|~_©_~|~ Investment ~|~_©_~|~ Management ~|~_©_~|~ Transportation ~|~_©_~|~ USAID,Egypt,AID-263-IO-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ 263-A-00-03-00053-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACX308.pdf,852 KB,"011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

PD-ACU-968,"The Quality Control and Certification (QCC) Project was designed to support the Chambers of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture (CCIA) food labs in Saida, Zahle and Tripoli.&nbsp; The objective was to assist the labs to become recognized leading facilities for testing in Lebanon.&nbsp; The project sought to assist the labs with equipment and capacity building so that each lab would achieve ISO 17025 and ISO 9001 accreditation.&nbsp; ISO (International Organization for Standardization) is the internationally recognized body established to ensure that products and services are safe, reliable and of good quality.&nbsp; ISO 17025 is the main ISO standard used by testing and calibration laboratories.&nbsp; ISO 9001 sets the standards for quality management systems.&nbsp; Compliance with the ISO standards ensures that quality management and technical systems are in place that will see the labs consistently produce valid results.&nbsp; Lab accreditation coupled with CCIA certifications allows the CCIA to operate as one-stop export shops and that provide reliable and efficient test results to Lebanese processors.&nbsp; The project came at a time when food safety in Lebanon became a major concern as some Lebanese products were rejected from export markets.&nbsp; High levels of pesticide residue and low-quality standards had affected Lebanon's ability to export.&nbsp; Supporting testing facilities and expanding the range of services outside Beirut was viewed as key for improving the competiveness of the agro-food industry and raising the quality of exported products ultimately resulting in increased exports.&nbsp; Overall the project has succeeded in enhancing Lebanon's export potential by supporting the three CCIA labs in achieving the needed ISO accreditation.&nbsp; Specifically, the key findings of the evaluation include: (1) the CCIA labs in Tripoli and Zahle and Saida achieved ISO 17025 accreditation that is inclusive of ISO 9001 accreditation; (2) all three labs now have the capabilities of one-stop-export shops; (3) QCC has helped the food industry by developing the enabling environment for export so that food processors can demonstrate to the export market that they produce high quality and safe products; (4) lab accreditation and the proximity of the labs to producers will act as a catalyst for increased exports; (5) based on revenue generated from the lab tests reported in income statements, two out of the three labs are currently assessed to be financially sustainable; and (6) none of the clients faced difficulty in export following testing their products in Lebanon and none had their goods returned.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",USAID indefinite quantity contract no. listed on document as RAN-I-00-09-00019,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,RAN-I-00-09-00019-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00019,,8/1/2012 0:00,,Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Economics ~|~_©_~|~ Exports ~|~_©_~|~ Finance ~|~_©_~|~ Management ~|~_©_~|~ Marketing ~|~_©_~|~ Nutrition,Lebanon,EDH-A-00-08-00006-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU968.pdf,1590 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID),English,application/pdf,,,,Agricultural management,Aug-12,,,,Agricultural product quality control and certification (QCC) program : final external evaluation report,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTY3NzYy,Lebanon,,,2012-08-01,2012,LBN,LBN_2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

(DELIVER Project), University Research Co., LL (Health Care Improvement Project), NicaSalud Federation (FamiSalud project) and MSH (PRONICASS Project). &nbsp;Taking into account the USAID Technical Note on Graduation for Family Planning and based on the findings discussed in this section, the evaluation team concludes that Nicaragua has achieved a successful graduation stage and that it is reasonable to expect that the provision of family planning (FP) services will be sustained in the future, that the Contraceptive Prevalence Rate (CPR) will be maintained at the level achieved prior to graduation and that inequities in access will not be increased. &nbsp;Overall, the implementation of USAID/Nicaragua's FPGS has been successful. &nbsp;USAID has achieved the main goals included in the strategy, and 15 of the 17 indicators defined by the FPGS have been met. &nbsp;The two unmet indicators, which are related to market segmentation and the participation of the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the social security in the market share, are in the process of being achieved. &nbsp;Through the implementation of the FPGS, USAID contributed to establishing a foundation for a solid, efficient and sustainable provision of family planning services in Nicaragua. &nbsp;It should also be noted that all recommendations presented in the mid-term evaluation of 2010 were implemented and monitored by the USAID health office, allowing adjustments to be made during implementation. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</span>",Inside title: USAID/Nicaragua family planning graduation strategy : final evaluacion report [sic],Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-524-O-12-00006,,10/1/2012 0:00,,Demographic surveys ~|~_©_~|~ Diseases ~|~_©_~|~ Health ~|~_©_~|~ Management ~|~_©_~|~ Marketing ~|~_©_~|~ USAID,Nicaragua,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU908.pdf,1190 KB,,,008584 - USAID.

PD-ACU-683,"The report begins with a brief review of the historical and contemporary context of the project in Angola. It then presents an historical overview of ProAgro, including a presentation of the primary goals and objectives of the program. These goals and objectives are then analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. This review is based on documentary data collected, and observations made, by the author during a three-week visit to the program in late April and early May 2012. The final two sections of the report present the reviewer's conclusions and recommendations related to the program. The emphasis in these concluding sections is on lessons learned from the six years of CLUSA's agricultural cooperative development experience that can be applied to future such projects especially related to coffee and bananas in Angola and also to similar agricultural cooperative development projects in other countries. ProAgro has been largely successful in carrying out a value chain project that has benefited over 6,000 farmers in Kwanza Sul, Benguela and Bengo provinces. It has set the stage for increases in production and marketing for the future through its development of 25 cooperatives, 12 co-op service centers, CESACOOPA ( a union of cooperatives in Kwanza Sul), and the proposed Cooperative Federation in Benguela. Both coffee and banana production now appear to be nearing a critical mass in which coordinated marketing through CESACOOPA, the planned Cooperative Federation in Benguela, and the co-ops have the potential to play major roles in increasing producer returns and continuing production and productivity.",Submitted as: ProAgro-Angola evaluation 2006-2012 (Avaliacao do ProAgro-Angola 2012) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Agricultural development and finance program (ADFP) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title also known as: ProAgro Angola ~|~_©_~|~ Portuguese ed.: PD-ACU-684,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,,,5/1/2012 0:00,,Agricultural development ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural management ~|~_©_~|~ Economic growth ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural cooperatives ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Farmers ~|~_©_~|~ Food production ~|~_©_~|~ Coffee ~|~_©_~|~ Bananas,Angola,690-A-00-06-00099-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-690-A-00-06-00099,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU683.pdf,1267 KB,,,008507 - USAID.

PD-ACU-680,"The Kosovo American Education Fund (KAEF) is a fellowship program for Kosovars that was established in 2004 from proceeds generated from the sale of the American Bank of Kosovo.&nbsp; The bank shares were held by the Kosovo Business Finance Fund (KBFF), established by USAID in 1999.&nbsp; The proceeds in the amount of US$7,881,825.25 formed the base of the grant agreement with the American Councils for International Education (AC) to establish the Kosovo American Education Fund.&nbsp; The goal of the KAEF is to provide Kosovar's with the education they need to lead Kosovo's economic development.&nbsp; Since its establishment, 51 Fellows have received KAEF support to attend masters programs in the U.S.&nbsp; The expectation was that income generated by the endowment would support at least ten Fellows annually.&nbsp; Additional resources that AC was expected to generate from other donors would enable AC to augment that number of Fellows.&nbsp; Because the ultimate objective of the effort was Kosovo's economic development, scholarships were limited to fields of study such as business, public administration, economics, international affairs, policy, and urban planning.&nbsp; This report presents the results of an evaluation of this program requested by the USAID Mission to Kosovo (USAID/K) and conducted in June and July, 2012.&nbsp; Conclusions reached by the evaluators are: (1) KAEF is a success with respect to producing degree graduates, although at a level somewhat lower than expected; and (2) KAEF has not performed as expected financially, and it will cease to exist if current financial trends continue.&nbsp; Recommendations include: (1) review KAEF's finances to determine what can reasonably be done to make KAEF's financial future more secure; (2) improve program analysis and reporting; (3) increase Kosovar involvement in decision-making and fundraising; (4) review options to increase the development impact since not all master's degrees -- not even all degrees in the currently accepted fields -- have the same development impact; (5) address the participation of women and minorities; (6) find ways to strengthen linkages Fellows host U.S. universities and other Fellows, to enhance follow-up activities in Kosovo; and (7) convince more Fellows to return to Kosovo since not returning reduces the program's impact.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","""It was prepared under Task Order AID-167-M-12-00001 under GEM II BPA AID-EDH-E-00-08-00003"" ~|~_©_~|~ Task order title: Global evaluation and monitoring II (GEM II)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-167-M-12-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-EDH-E-00-08-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ EDH-E-00-08-00003-00,,8/1/2012 0:00,,Educational development ~|~_©_~|~ Banks ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Income generation ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ School graduates ~|~_©_~|~ Masters degrees ~|~_©_~|~ Higher education ~|~_©_~|~ Girls education,Kosovo,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU680.pdf,674 KB,"013070 - JBS International, Inc.

(DAI).&nbsp; AAC has three components: (1) strengthening producer capacity for competitive commercial farming; (2) strengthening capacity for market development; and (3) increasing access to, and use of, timely and reliable market information.&nbsp; It also uses crosscutting mechanisms such as grants, credit facilitation, and policy and regulatory reform dialogue to stimulate a more competitive enabling environment.&nbsp; Using four criteria for selecting interventions -- demand prospects in domestic and export markets, potential for growth, feasibility, and meeting development objectives -- AAC has focused on five strategic value chains and associated activities: (1) tree crops; (2) greenhouse crops; (3) open-field crops; (4) medicinal and aromatic plants; and (5) processed commodities.&nbsp; In implementing its program, AAC has targeted constraints and capitalized on opportunities throughout the entire value chain for the targeted commodities, from improved farm and postharvest technologies to trade facilitation in domestic and export markets.&nbsp; The major objectives of the AAC evaluation are to: (1) assess AAC performance and achievements to date; (2) identify best practices and lessons-learned from program implementation; (3) assess and recommend any other opportunities in the agriculture sector that should be considered for future funding; and (4) provide USAID/Albania with practical and implementable recommendations for core USAID support to the agricultural sector using host country institutions.&nbsp; Some of the evaluators' findings include: (1) examination of AAC targets and actual achievements reveals that the project has met or exceeded its targets for all indicators since program inception; (2) AAC's contributions to Albania's performance in the agricultural sector are substantial; (3) AAC collaboration with Ministry of Agriculture, Food, and Consumer Protection (MOAFCP)has been outstanding; (4) five years into AAC implementation, the original assumptions of the program remain valid; (5) building on the success of the AAC program, a follow-up initiative is justified.&nbsp; The evaluators also provide seven emendations to be considered after the ACC has ended in January 2013.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Cover title: Performance evaluation of the Albanian agricultural competitiveness (AAC) program ~|~_©_~|~ Title in footer: Evaluation of Albania agriculture competitiveness project ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Albanian agricultureal competitiveness (AAC),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-182-TO-12-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00018 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00018-00,,7/1/2012 0:00,,Agricultural markets ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural technology ~|~_©_~|~ Crops ~|~_©_~|~ Exports ~|~_©_~|~ Farmers ~|~_©_~|~ Farms ~|~_©_~|~ Traders ~|~_©_~|~ Value chains,Albania,EDH-I-08-05-00004-00 ~|~_©_~|~ EDH-I-00-05-00004-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-EDH-I-08-05-00004 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-EDH-I-00-05-00004,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU529.pdf,601 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates,,"008506 - USAID.

PD-ACU-379,"<span style=""font-family: Arial; font-size: small;"">The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) provided technical assistance to the National Tuberculosis Control Program of Mexico based on a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed in 1999 by Presidents Bill Clinton and Ernesto Zedillo and a strategic objective grant agreement (SOAG) in 2000. &nbsp;The strategic objective was to develop a sustainable and effective institutional capacity to diagnose, control, and monitor tuberculosis in target areas. &nbsp;USAID's commitment was approximately US$16 million; support started in 2004 and ended in 2012. &nbsp;The project aimed to increase political commitment to the TB program, increase use of laboratory-based diagnosis, improve directly observed therapy, and strengthen mechanisms to monitor program activities to reach 70 percent TB case detection and 85 percent cure rate. &nbsp;This evaluation aims to: (1) update the findings and recommendations from the 2010 evaluation of activities by USAID and the Tuberculosis Coalition for Technical Assistance (TBCTA); (2) document USAID's legacy in Mexico for TB control; (3) assess the sustainability of USAID investments in Mexico for TB; (4) identify priority activities at risk of not being continued after the phase-out of USAID support; and (5) recommend options for ensuring sustainability. &nbsp;The document also analyzes the past and current epidemiological situation of tuberculosis in Mexico and includes recommendations to USAID and to the National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) for future action to sustain gains and increase the impact of control activities on TB transmission, incidence, and mortality. &nbsp;The evaluators concluded that USAID cooperation had a major impact on the national capacity for TB control, disproportionate to the funds invested (~US$0.01 per capita per year). &nbsp;The main areas strengthened were: (1) the laboratory network; (2) human resource capacity at national, state, and district level; (3) the information system; (4) and MDR-TB diagnosis and case management. &nbsp;Technical cooperation accelerated DOTS implementation and increased political commitment at national level and in geographical areas in addition to the priority states. &nbsp;There were increased treatment success rates, and the strategic objectives of case detection and treatment success were achieved. &nbsp;In areas with direct support to service improvement, PP/PPM and ACSM, the detection of suspects and notification of smear-positive pulmonary TB cases increased rapidly. &nbsp;(Excerpt, modified)</span>","""This document was prepared .... under the Tuberculosis Indefinite Quantity Contract (TB IQC) Task Order 01 (TO2015), GHN-I-00-09-00006-01."" ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Tuberculosis indefinite quantity contract (TB IQC)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,GHN-I-01-09-00006-00 ~|~_©_~|~ GHN-I-00-09-00006-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GHN-I-01-09-00006 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GHN-I-00-09-00006,,10/1/2012 0:00,,Tuberculosis ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Disease transmission ~|~_©_~|~ Mortality ~|~_©_~|~ Multidrug-resistant/extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/XDR-TB) ~|~_©_~|~ Community mobilization,Mexico,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU379.pdf,1037 KB,006425 - Program for Appropriate Technology in Health (PATH),,"011222 - USAID.

PD-ACU-357,"The purpose of the USAID/South Africa (SA) Umbrella Grant Management (UGM) evaluation was to inform the design of the next UGM. The evaluation focused on strengths and weaknesses of three bilateral UGM partners (or UGMPs): FHI360, Pact, and Right to Care. It also focused on a fourth project (the FHI360 Capable Partners project) in a variety of domains. FHI360 Capable Partners, or CAP, was not a UGM, but rather a Leader with Associate Award under a global award. Therefore, throughout the report, UGMPs is used to refer to the first three UGMPs, and CAP is addressed separately, due to its different aims, methodologies and funding mechanism. The evaluation teams overall observation, based on documentation and interviews with UGM and USAID, is that all three UGMPs ensured compliance and accountability for US funds. There were few instances of noncompliance or nonperformance by the SPs managed by the UGMPs; in these limited cases, the evidence seen suggests that the UGMPs discovered the issues quickly and took prompt action. The SI team observed that minor flaws in financial management, governance, or leadership, if not addressed rapidly and pro-actively, have the potential to escalate to major flaws.",,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,,,5/1/2012 0:00,,Grants ~|~_©_~|~ HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Development program management ~|~_©_~|~ Child feeding programs ~|~_©_~|~ Nutrition improvement,South Africa,674-A-00-08-00001-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 674-A-00-08-00002-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 674-A-00-08-00003-00 ~|~_©_~|~ 674-A-00-09-00001-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-674-A-00-08-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-674-A-00-08-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-674-A-00-08-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-674-A-00-09-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU357.pdf,1656 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,000035 - U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID),English,application/pdf,Performance evaluation (2011 definition),,,HIV / AIDS,May-12,,,,South Africa umbrella grants management (UGM) performance evaluation,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MTY0OTkz,,,,2012-05-01,2012,ZAF,ZAF_2012,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

PD-ACU-512,"The purpose of this performance evaluation is to assess the results of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)-funded Elections and Political Processes Program (EPP Program) in Colombia designed to strengthen political parties and electoral processes in Colombia. The Program was implemented by the International Republican Institute (IRI) and the National Democratic Institute (NDI) from 2007 to 2012. This evaluation examines implementing partners activities, evaluates their results, identifies lessons learned and best practices, and develops recommendations for possible future USAID support. The Elections and Political Processes program has been successful in many respects. Colombian partners and beneficiaries acknowledge the value of working with NDI and IRI and the importance of partnering with them to advance their interests. NDI and IRI were recognized by a vast majority of interviewees as critical players in Colombia, as unlike local organizations, these international Institutes achieved unparalleled convening power, and managed to reach agreements among often seemingly irreconcilable organizations and/or leaders on a range of issues.

PD-ACU-293,"USAID/Serbia's Preparedness, Planning and Economic Security (PPES) Project is a five-year $25 million project implemented by Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI).&nbsp; It consists of two distinct but related components: preparedness planning (PP) and economic security (ES).&nbsp; It began in May 2006 and was originally scheduled to end in 2011, and the preparedness planning component ended then.&nbsp; The contract was amended to add eighteen months for the economic security component.&nbsp; The objective of this performance evaluation was to conduct a full, evidence-based and independent review of USAID-financed activities under PPES.&nbsp; The purpose of the evaluation was: (1) to examine the effectiveness of project activities to date; (2) to determine whether the project has achieved planned results; (3) to identify gaps in performance against targets; and (4) in the case of activities under economic security component, to provide recommendations on closing these gaps in the final year of the project.&nbsp; At the request of the mission, further consideration was given to identifying lessons learned and recommendations for consideration in future funding.&nbsp; The evaluation's overall findings are: (1) PPES has met or exceeded requirements of the project; (2) DAI's reports are consistent with the findings of this evaluation, with one minor exception; (3) the failure to have any progress in government-to-government dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia is having a broad negative impact on PPES' ability to help business expand across borders and it also limits linkages in youth activities; and (4) the economic downturn has limited export markets and slowed business growth throughout Serbia, including those firms included in the performance evaluation.&nbsp; Some overall recommendations at the program level were made as well: (1) migrate some of the best, ongoing work in Youth and Business Support to other ongoing or planned initiatives; (2) the PPES Grants program had a high level of impact, but is understated; (3) USAID/Serbia should initiate new designs or interventions now so as not to lose the momentum that PPES has been providing; (4) six changes in Contracting Officer Technical Representative (COTR), now titled COR, occurred during the life of PPES; given the caliber of the technical national staff within USAID/Serbia, that such authorities and responsibilities be vested in a permanent national staff; and (5) having locally identified staff work in region-specific positions is highly recommended as it facilitates all aspects of program implementation.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)","""This Final Evaluation Report was prepared .... under Evaluation Services IQC task order AID-169-TO-12-00002."" ~|~_©_~|~ Title in footer: PPES performance evaluation : final evaluation report ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order title: Preparedness, planning and economic security (PPES)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-169-TO-12-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00016 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00016-00,,9/1/2012 0:00,,Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Economic planning ~|~_©_~|~ Industrial security ~|~_©_~|~ Performance indicators ~|~_©_~|~ Border areas ~|~_©_~|~ Youth ~|~_©_~|~ Institutional linkages ~|~_©_~|~ Exports ~|~_©_~|~ Market development ~|~_©_~|~ Economic growth,Serbia,DFD-I-01-05-00250-00 ~|~_©_~|~ DFD-I-00-05-00250-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-DFD-I-01-05-00250 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-DFD-I-00-05-00250,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU293.pdf,710 KB,"International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

PD-ACU-206,"According to its logical framework, the purpose of the MDP is to increase the accountability of municipal governments to the communities they serve and to achieve broad community participation in decisionmaking and oversight of local public investments. However, the performance of the program was not uniform in all municipalities. The sensitive political setting in Cabinda and the difficult socio-economic conditions in Cuito Cuanavale influenced on the relatively weaker performance of these municipalities in some outputs. One of the insights stemming from this is that, due to the approach adopted that privileged the adoption of a model that could be used for all municipalities, the program might have overlooked the different contexts where it operated, applying a standardized approach in all components for all cases. Whilst the alternative of applying different policy models for different municipalities cannot be considered realistic, finding ways to address the specificities of the municipalities in a diverse country like Angola is important to ensure the relevance and effectiveness of governance interventions like the MDP.",Evaluated project title: Municipal development program (MDP) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project also known as: Municipal development program-Angola (MDP-Angola) ~|~_©_~|~ Mid-term evaluation: PD-ACT-367,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,,,3/1/2012 0:00,,Municipal level ~|~_©_~|~ Political development ~|~_©_~|~ Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Community development ~|~_©_~|~ Political participation ~|~_©_~|~ Governance,Angola,690-A-00-06-00067-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-690-A-00-06-00067-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU206.pdf,1001 KB,,,008507 - USAID.

PD-ACU-197,"The Gender Equity through Education (GEE) Program was funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and implemented by Winrock International in close partnership with the Republic of South Sudan Ministry of General Education &amp; Instruction (RSS/MoGEI).&nbsp; USAID established GEE on March 23, 2007 to continue, accelerate, and expand accomplishments achieved under the Gender Equity Support Program (GESP) which ran from July 2002 to September 2007.&nbsp; The GEE project objectives were to increase the number of girls and women attending secondary school, and teacher training institutes (TTIs) by reducing financial and infrastructure, social, and institutional barriers.&nbsp; Its components included: (1) stipends for secondary school and TTI students; (2) a mentoring program; (3) small school improvement grants; and (4) technical assistance to the MoGEI and State Ministries of Education (SMoEs).&nbsp; The objective of this final performance evaluation are: (1) to ascertain the extent to which the mid-term evaluation recommendations were implemented; (2) whether project objectives and indicator targets were met; and (3) the efficacy of the overall design.&nbsp; The evaluation was undertaken in May and June 2012, and included both qualitative and quantitative methods including a review of relevant documents and the GEE Education Management Information System (EMIS,) interviews with GEE staff and government officials, and field visits to three states where evaluators interviewed teachers, parents, and students.&nbsp; The evaluators conclude that the GEE project is a good project embedded in a very weak system, a system that makes much of the GEE components either unsustainable or their benefits short-lived.&nbsp; While some important aspects of the project remained unimplemented until the latter years of the project, it generally came to be well executed.&nbsp; By the last years of the project, disbursement of stipends to over 5,300 beneficiaries over five years became well implemented and well monitored.&nbsp; GEE staff relationships and collaboration with national and state ministry officials appeared to be excellent and deeply appreciated.&nbsp; The evaluators have made recommendations, including: (1) all parties should better coordinate responses to evaluation recommendations and enable flexibility to respond to changing conditions in project settings; (2) capacity, sustainability, and exit strategies should be established before a project begins and required in all work plans from the very beginning; (3)projects must consider the broader institution enabling mechanisms (transportation, equipment, etc.) since their absence can limit the effects of any individual or institutional capacity improvements; and (4) any subsequent projects addressing gender equity and access should draw models from the Gender Thematic Working Group (GTWG), the Wau Mentor-Teachers' Union, and the Central Equatoria SMoE carry-on of the GEE mentor training regime.&nbsp; An additional six recommendations are included in the report.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)&nbsp;",Evaluated project title: Gender equity through education (GEE) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Services under program and project offices for results tracking (SUPPORT) ~|~_©_~|~ Midterm evaluation: PD-ACR-923,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,DFD-I-00-05-00251-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-DFD-I-00-05-00251,,6/1/2012 0:00,,Gender equity ~|~_©_~|~ Access to education ~|~_©_~|~ Girls education ~|~_©_~|~ Women,South Sudan,650-A-00070000300,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU197.pdf,2210 KB,"003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

PD-ACU-122,"The South Sudan Health Transformation Project phase II (SHTP II) was developed to strengthen local health systems and improve the delivery of services to patients while also increasing the local demand for services.&nbsp; The project ran from February 2009 to October 2012 with a total available funding of $58,497,880.&nbsp; SHTP II had three result areas: (1) service delivery; (2) health system strengthening; and (3) demand increase.&nbsp; The project was designed to accelerate health system development by making the provision of essential health services compatible with the Ministry of Health's (MOH's) capacity to manage the service delivery system.&nbsp; Management Sciences for Health (MSH) was contracted to manage SHTP II and provide support to 166 government-owned health facilities through performance-based contracts (PBCs) with lead agencies in each of the 14 focus counties.&nbsp; The seven high-impact services to be provided were based on the MOHs Basic Package of Health Services (BPHS), including: child health, nutrition, hygiene and sanitation, malaria, maternal health, family planning (FP), and prevention of HIV/AIDS.&nbsp; To underpin delivery of these essential services, SHTP II was designed to support the strengthening of South Sudan's health systems at the facility and county levels.&nbsp; Under SHTP II, emphasis was also put on involving the community and increasing its demand for health services.&nbsp; The purpose of this end of project (EOP) evaluation, which was based on a series of specific research questions, is to understand the strengths and weaknesses of SHTP II's approach to its three stated result areas in order to develop recommendations for new health program planning and for USAID's South Sudan health portfolio in general.&nbsp; The evaluation took place during May and June 2012 and relied on an extensive document review, key informant interviews, a rapid survey of sub-contracted partners, and field visits to a representative sample of health facilities.&nbsp; The findings of the evaluation are: (1) service delivery: the evaluation found that the SHTP II project achieved some encouraging results at the supported facilities, however, the availability of services was vulnerable to persistent supply and equipment shortages and lack of qualified health workers; (2) in health systems strengthening, the evaluation assessed response to health system challenges at the facility and county levels, with the process revealing that the very low baseline of national health systems posed significant implementation challenges for SHTP II and the sustainability of health services; (3) increasing demand for services: the project successfully used standardized trainings to rapidly increase the number of trained community members, namely home health promoters and village health committees.&nbsp; The evaluators also outline specific recommendations for each of the project's result areas.&nbsp; (Excerpt, modified)",Evaluated project title: Sudan health transformation project phase II (SHTP II) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Services under program and project offices for results tracking (SUPPORT),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,DFD-I-00-05-00251-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-DFD-I-00-05-00251,,7/1/2012 0:00,,Health delivery ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Demand ~|~_©_~|~ Health care systems ~|~_©_~|~ Health facilities ~|~_©_~|~ Community based delivery,South Sudan,GHS-I-00-07-00006-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACU122.pdf,2715 KB,"003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

PD-ACT-903,"The Accelerating Sustainable Agriculture Program (ASAP) followed other USAID funded agriculture development programs with similar objectives. The intent was to continue moving agriculture along the spectrum from the farm gate to higher levels within the processing sector, with the end goal of increasing exports as an engine for development. The project ended in October 2011 with interest in an evaluation two-fold: assess the performance and reach of the activities implemented under ASAP and pose lessons learned that might impact future program considerations along this farm gate to export continuum. The evaluation process considered the four focus areas of the project: agribusiness investments, agriculture inputs, agriculture services provided to the sector, and advisory services provided to the ministry, which formed the basis for addressing the questions posed in the Statement of Work. ASAP achieved much success, pointing the way to better post harvest quality products and moving traders and exporters to higher levels of performance. Strides were made in providing services and better technologies down to the farm gate.

PD-ACT-744,"Pakistans large and rapidly growing population challenges the country's ability to provide essential services, economic opportunities, and a good quality of life for its citizens. Furthermore, high total fertility rates put children and women at greater risk for higher mortality and poor overall health. Most non-first births in Pakistan fall into the high-risk category, and infant and maternal mortality rates remain high. Evidence shows that longer intervals between births can reduce the incidence of both neonatal and maternal mortality. Pakistan instituted a comprehensive and detailed family planning program in the mid-1960s to address the impact of poor birth spacing and high fertility and has continued to explore different approaches to expand family planning services, improve quality, and reach underserved areas. Family planning services were delivered primarily through the separate Population and Welfare Ministry and not connected to the Ministry of Health services.",'Contracted Under No. GS-23F-8012H and Order No. AID-391-M-11-00001' ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Family advancement for life and health (FALAH) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Independent monitoring and evaluation contract (IMEC),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-391-M-11-00001,,3/1/2012 0:00,,Family health care ~|~_©_~|~ Population growth ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Health service utilization ~|~_©_~|~ Quality of life ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Fertility ~|~_©_~|~ Women ~|~_©_~|~ Maternal mortality ~|~_©_~|~ Child mortality ~|~_©_~|~ Health risk,Pakistan,391-A-00-07-01092-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT744.pdf,2316 KB,"003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

PD-ACT-652,"ESI was specifically concerned with information systems that measure and inform the United States Government (USG) PEPFAR program in South Africa, and the South African Government (SAG) HIV and AIDS program activities. The ESI Project (and thus this evaluation) focused on two distinct areas: 1) refinements to the web-based information system for program reporting and performance monitoring; 2) building the capacity of PEPFAR and SAG implementing partners to collect, report, and use high-quality data and strategic information for purposes of program management at the implementation level.The Project was designed to put in place a technical assistance organization/contractor with the technical scope and capacity to refine the information systems structure to improve its user interaction, and analytical functionality and tools; to serve as the information systems administrator and technical support office for users; and to simultaneously build the awareness, motivation and capacity PEPFAR and SAG managers to place high value on data quality and use of data/information for performance management purposes.This evaluation was both summative and formative in nature. It covered the period from inception of ESI in 2008, through March 2012, and considered key areas of ESI Project performance including: the appropriateness of the Projects development hypothesis; the adequacy of the Projects management; and the Projects performance including key achievements and gaps.

PD-ACT-716,"The Copper Cobalt Conflict (CCC) Project implemented by PACT International (PACT) and funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) aimed to promote peace and security in the artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sector in and around Kolwezi, a mineral-rich area in Katanga Province, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The specific objectives of the project were to: a) promote reconciliation, cooperation and understanding among all stakeholders within the ASM sector, and prevent and mitigate conflicts over access to and use of resources; b) raise awareness and provide technical support to prevent health risks, accidents and injuries at the mines; c) raise awareness and strengthen understanding of the mining code and related legislation; and, d) establish conflict resolution mechanisms to promote peace.The evaluation findings indicate that overall, project activities contributed to achieving project objectives by: a) reducing conflicts at mining sites by supporting the establishment of grassroots cooperatives that organized miners and upheld their rights; b) providing technical support to reduce accidents and injuries at the mines; c) strengthening the capacity of ASM-related institutions to resolve and mitigate conflict through dialogue and peaceful means; and, d) educating stakeholders on their roles, rights and responsibilities under the mining code and legislation.",Footer title: Final evaluation of PACT CCC project ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Copper cobalt conflict (CCC),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-623-TO-10-00004 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00015 ~|~_©_~|~ RAN-I-00-09-00015-00,,4/1/2012 0:00,,Copper ~|~_©_~|~ Cobalt ~|~_©_~|~ Conflict resolution ~|~_©_~|~ Peace ~|~_©_~|~ Mining ~|~_©_~|~ Minerals ~|~_©_~|~ Political reconciliation ~|~_©_~|~ Public awareness ~|~_©_~|~ Accidents ~|~_©_~|~ Wounds and injuries ~|~_©_~|~ Cultural cooperation,Congo DR,AID-623-A-09-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACT716.pdf,1228 KB,"011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

PD-ACT-620,"<p class=""MsoNormal"" style=""margin: 0in 0in 10pt;""><span style=""font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;"">Market-based Partnerships for Health (MBPH) was a $13.5 million USAID/India funded project implemented by Abt Associates between October 1, 2008 and May 11, 2012. MBPH aimed to improve the environment for commercial sector engagement in USAID/India&rsquo;s key priority health areas by forging partnerships between the private and public sectors. MBPH fostered market-based partnerships in: (1) reproductive health, maternal health, and child health, including promotion of good hygiene, such as hand washing; (2) safe water; (3) prevention of indoor air pollution (IAP); and (4) the control of tuberculosis. MBPH, which was operational in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand and Karnataka, had two primary objectives: (1) build on, implement, institutionalize, and scale-up MBPH models; and (2) explore new commercial-sector opportunities to accelerate public health improvements, especially in base-of-pyramid (BoP) and rural population groups, improving access, demand, and service delivery through health and non-health partners. The program aimed to create and nurture MBPH models that can be brought to scale by commercial partners, government programs, and/or civil society groups. The program also sought to institutionalize local capacity to broker market-based partnerships for health in the future by supporting the establishment of a Center of Excellence. The final evaluation had three purposes: (1) review and analyze the overall program strategies and technical approaches adopted; (2) review and assess the effectiveness of the processes adopted for MBPH innovations, including planning, monitoring, finance, and technical support; and (3) provide recommendations on future directions, especially introducing new and/or continuing approaches for innovations with the private sector. The evaluators found that MBPH project successfully designed, implemented, and evaluated a wide range of private partnerships and initiatives that addressed a number of critical public health issues. In less than four years, and with a modest budget, MPBH made significant progress, building upon previous partnership models and exploring new opportunities to engage commercial private sector partners to test approaches ultimately designed to improve health outcomes for BoP families. The key MBPH achievements are: (1) developed eight partnership models; (2) demonstrated some success in execution, cost sharing, and commitment of partners to scale-up (or at least have scale-up potential) in each model; (3) introduced nine health companies to profitable BoP markets; and (4) leveraged over six million dollars from partners.

PD-ACT-577,"Balochistan is the least developed province of Pakistan. Besides a higher incidence of poverty than other provinces, Balochistan also exhibits a higher level of gender disparity due to lack of education and conservative social norms. According to the Labor Force Survey 2010-11, Balochistan's female labor force participation was at six percent. This is much lower than the national average of 15 percent or that of Punjab at 20 percent. Most women lack mobility and are largely homebound. Even women who are involved in agricultural activities serve as unpaid family workers and their ownership of important assets or land appears to be extremely limited. While homebound, the women of Balochistan inherit a rich tradition of embroidery.

It totaled $12,273,815 in USAID funding, with $7,528,815 for NDI programs and $4,745,000 for IRI programs. The program focused primarily on supporting the development of political parties in Serbia. The overall goal of the program was to support USAID/Serbia's Strategic Objective 3: Risk of Political Instability Reduced through support of key democratic structures and processes. Based on the findings of this evaluation, this goal should be considered successfully achieved. Pro-democratic forces prevailed in every election during the time period of this program, especially in the election of 2008, which brought to power a party coalition that has maintained a stable government since that time.",Task order no.

The specific objectives of this assessment are to inform the decision of whether to continue work in the informal justice sector beyond the termination of RLS-I project, and if so, how to design this work.

PD-ACT-242,"USAID Liberia initiated the Land Rights and Community Forestry Program (LRCFP) in December of 2007 to advance the policy and practice of land and forest management in Liberia. The program was designed to improve the legal and policy environment for community forest management, build the capacity of the national forest service and communities to develop and sustain community forestry programs and generate environmentallysustainable and equitable economic benefits for rural residents. At the national level, LRCFP supported the passage of the Community Rights Law and associated regulations, and built the capacity of the Forestry Development Authority (FDA). At the local level, the program facilitated the creation of five community forests and introduced improved livelihood practices in Nimba and Sinoe Counties. Work of the primary contractor for LRCFP concluded on October 28, 2011.The purpose of this evaluation is to assess the implementation and impact of LRCFP, identify strategies taken to adapt to evolving challenges and opportunities, and determine and report on the implications for further investment in Liberia and for USAID more broadly. A team of five specialists in agriculture, forestry, biodiversity and land tenure reviewed the available documentation and spent two weeks in Liberia engaging with national and community participants in the program. Although intense rains and time constraints limited access to community participants, the team nevertheless interviewed over 30 community representatives and 50 people total.

PD-ACS-486,"This report evaluates the performance of the Support for Trade Acceleration Projects (USAID/STAR I and STAR II) that were conducted under contract to Development Alternatives, Inc. (DAI) in Vietnam between 2001 and 2010 and ventures a look forward, partially based on the scope of work for the follow-up to STAR II, known as STAR+. The confluence of a unique set of circumstances created the initial demand for STAR in 2001 and gave it the impetus to propel it forward. The Government of Vietnam (GVN) adopted a new economic growth strategy in the 1990s to transition to a market-based economy and open the economy to international trade. The GVN used a bilateral trade agreement (BTA) with the United States and accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO) as instruments to accelerate the transition process. The GVN requested technical assistance to facilitate revision of its commercial laws, legal procedures, transparency and appeals processes to meet BTA and WTO requirements. The GVN established an effective command structure to coordinate and direct technical assistance, backed by GVN senior political authority. USAID management granted broad operational flexibility to the technical assistance providers. USAID/Vietnams STAR Project Performance: Notwithstanding STARs enormous advantage in providing assistance to a host country government that placed high priority on legal and procedural reforms, STAR effectively delivered a large volume and variety of technical assistance typically using the same tools employed by other USAID technical assistance projects (e.g. technical experts, workshops, study tours, discussions and seminars with clients), but with greater impact. The STAR programs accomplished their objective to help the GVN satisfy BTA and WTO accession requirements.",Evaluated project title: Support for trade acceleration I (STAR I) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Support for trade acceleration II (STAR II) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Business growth initiative (BGI),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,EEM-C-00-06-00022-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-EEM-C-00-06-00022,,5/1/2011 0:00,,Trade promotion ~|~_©_~|~ International trade ~|~_©_~|~ Economic growth ~|~_©_~|~ Strategic planning ~|~_©_~|~ Market development ~|~_©_~|~ Economies in transition ~|~_©_~|~ Commercial law ~|~_©_~|~ Transparency ~|~_©_~|~ Business support services,Vietnam,GEG-I-05-04-00001-00 ~|~_©_~|~ GEG-I-00-04-00001-00 ~|~_©_~|~ PCE-I-833-98-00017-00 ~|~_©_~|~ PCE-I-00-98-00017-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GEG-I-05-04-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GEG-I-00-04-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-PCE-I-00-98-00017,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACS486.pdf,619 KB,"007239 - Weidemann Associates, Inc.",,"011274 - USAID.

PD-ACS-202,"The purpose of this report is to provide an independent and objective assessment of the developmental impact of the 27-year United States Telecommunications Training Institutes (USTTI) ICT training program. Established in 1982 as a 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation, USTTI is a public-private partnership (PPP) between the United States Government (USG) and US-based telecommunications/ICT companies. It provides a wide range of specialized, tuition-free training to policy-makers, regulators and public- and private-sector executives and professionals from the developing world. The program has offered 1,600 individual training courses at a variety of locations in the US and graduated over 8,000 women and men representing 168 countries worldwide. From the outset, USTTI has received financial and technical support from a variety of corporate, academic and USG sources. Since 2005, USTTI has received $1 million annually from USAID, while the cumulative total from USAID since 1985 under a succession of grant agreements has amounted to $15,942,785. The Impact Assessments findings and conclusions are based on: (1) a review of pertinent documentation; (2) interviews with USAID personnel, USTTI board members and staff, representatives of USG institutions and private corporations involved in the USTTI program, and instructors/presenters; (3) an electronic survey of training participants; (4) telephone follow-up interviews with a sample of respondents to the electronic survey; and (5) visits to 11 countries to interview USTTI participants and their supervisors and colleagues. It should be noted that, due to lack of information, it was not possible to contact USTTI participants who were trained prior to 1996. Of the training recipients since 1996, 37% responded to the electronic survey. An important purpose of the telephone and site visit data collection was to explore the extent of, and potentially correct for, any positive bias in the survey response.",Cover title: United States Telecommunications Training Institute impact assessment : final evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Footer title: USTTI impact assessment ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global broadband and innovations (GBi) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title also known as: Project title: GBI broadband and innovations,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,RAN-I-00-09-00015-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-RAN-I-00-09-00015 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-CIO-TO-10-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-CIO-I-10-00001,,7/1/2011 0:00,,Information systems ~|~_©_~|~ Technical training ~|~_©_~|~ Impact assessment ~|~_©_~|~ Public private partnerships ~|~_©_~|~ Telecommunications technology ~|~_©_~|~ Mass media,Latin America ~|~_©_~|~ Central and Eastern Europe ~|~_©_~|~ East Africa,AID-CIO-TO-10-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-CIO-I-10-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDACS202.pdf,27206 KB,"011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

PD-ACR-169,"The Private Sector Competitiveness Enhancement Project (PSCEP) is a $6,588,557, three year project of USAID/Azerbaijan's Economic Growth office and implemented by Chemonics International.  The project began in September 2008, and will end in December 2010, ten months earlier than originally anticipated.  USAID/Azerbaijan has commissioned this assessment both as way of judging the effectiveness and impacts of the project, and also to provide guidance to USAID's successor project (Azerbaijan Competitiveness and Trade (ACT) project) which is starting in late 2010. Although there were some design and implementation problems that will be described below, and a difficult business environment overall, PSCEP did achieve at least two major successes: improvements in the dairy sector that have brought about substantial income gains for thousands of farmers, and re-establishment of the aquaculture industry in Azerbaijan after it had declined by 90% over the past twenty years. In most respects, PSCEP follows a fairly conventional competitiveness/value chain methodology.  However, three aspects of the design and/or implementation stand out as being different from similar projects in other countries, and it does appear that these differences have contributed to short-falls in overall project effectiveness: (1) an unnecessarily complex analytical process used in sector selection; (2) too much emphasis on investment as a primary project objective; and (3) an unrealistic timeline for achieving indicators, As a result, after fifteen months of the three-year project, 62% of the budget had been consumed.  Once the sector-specific technical assistance began, it does appear that much of it was effective.  There were particularly beneficial results in the dairy sector, and aquaculture.  Other firm-specific successes were noted with green-house farming and high-value agriculture (strawberries), but because often a small number of individuals benefitted, the cost-benefit of this assistance is questionable. It should be noted that private sector economic growth is difficult in Azerbaijan, mainly because of monopolization of key sectors in the economy and a general lack of transparency.  Even a well-designed and well-run project will have difficulty achieving significant results in Azerbaijan.  In addition, the project design contained certain mandated activities and targets that affected the implementation in negative ways.  That said, it is also clear that the project fell short of achieving some of its benchmarks and targets and that the work of the implementer was not always cost-effective. Among the key lessons that can be taken from this project are: (1) the necessity of having targets and benchmarks that are appropriate for the project goals and design; (2) to realize that proper timing and sequencing of actions is essential to sound project management; and (3) to manage the use of project resources so that they are applied in the most cost-effective manner relative to project goals.

PA-00N-6TH,"The purpose of the final performance evaluation of the Regional Integrated Trade and Food Security Strategy 2017-2017 (the Strategy), a USAID Central America (USAID/CAM) initiative, was to determine if the design and implementation of the four activities under the Strategy were effective in achieving the Strategy's expected results, and to inform on future programming in trade and food security based on that analysis.&nbsp; The evaluation covered implementation of the Strategy from its inception in September 2011 through September 30, 2016.&nbsp; It was based on evaluation questions and evaluation criteria, and included extensive document reviews, key informant interviews, site visits and an online survey.&nbsp; Its field work included interviews in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Costa Rica and the U.S.&nbsp; The evaluation found that strengthening of national governments' and regional entities' capacity for analysis and policy formulation related to trade facilitation and food security was one of the major accomplishments of the activities.&nbsp; The Strategy activities have contributed to producer organizations capacity building, but the impact on their income remains to be seen.&nbsp; There were no significant instances of collaboration among the four Strategy's activities, nor were they mandated or monitored.&nbsp; Same can be said about gender integration activities or interventions.&nbsp; Activities did contribute to the dissemination and use of science, technology and innovation for agricultural practices among small farmers, mostly through training and technical assistance.&nbsp; (Author abstract)",Cover title: Final performance evaluation : regional integrated trade and food security strategy 2011-2017,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-519-TO-16-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-15-00024,,8/1/2017 0:00,,Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Trade promotion ~|~_©_~|~ Regional trade ~|~_©_~|~ Local capacity building ~|~_©_~|~ Gender integration ~|~_©_~|~ Income generation ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural production ~|~_©_~|~ Farmers ~|~_©_~|~ Technical assistance,Central America,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00N6TH.pdf,2396 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates,,"013060 - USAID.

PA-00N-5VQ,"This evaluation is commissioned by the U.S. Agency for International Development in Bosnia and Herzegovina (USAID/BiH), in line with USAID's Evaluation Policy, to examine the 2010-2013 USAID/BiH Development Grants Program (DGP).&nbsp; The DGP's goal was to expand USAID's local NGO (LNGO) network of development partners and to provide capacity-building assistance to the new partners through supporting their initiatives.&nbsp; This performance evaluation answers six questions.&nbsp; The first three evaluation questions examine the nature of the USAID/BiH Mission's outreach and relationships with LNGOs in BiH and its post-DGP ability to directly partner with LNGOs in BiH.&nbsp; The remaining three questions examine how the work of the implementing LNGOs' sub-grantees was perceived and valued by end beneficiaries, whether the LNGOs' capacities changed as a result of their partnership with USAID, and whether they sustained their development efforts.&nbsp; The evaluation team employed a mixed-method approach.&nbsp; To address the evaluation questions, the evaluation team reviewed over 100 program implementation documents and databases and spoke with 143 interviewees.&nbsp; It found that DGP increased partnership opportunities for LNGOs and USAID/BiH Mission's ability to partner with nontraditional partners in the economic growth sector.&nbsp; However, further enlargement of direct partnering with LNGOs in the economic growth sector requires more funding opportunities for LNGOs' economic development initiatives and changes to the present approach of the Economic Development Office (EDO).&nbsp; The EDO's current activities are usually complex and large in terms of budget and scope and focus on achieving system level impacts rather than on increasing implementers' capacity.&nbsp; The DGP increased the implementing LNGOs' capacities to better meet their beneficiaries' needs, and the total number of end beneficiaries reached was substantial.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the achievements of the implemented activities were limited to the output level results.&nbsp; The weakest element of the Program was sustainability of the development efforts -- several organizations sustained their development efforts, but with significantly reduced scopes of work, or in sectors different than those supported by the DGP awards.&nbsp; The main evaluation recommendations for USAID/BiH's considerations (based on lessons learned from DGP and under the assumption that USAID/BiH chooses to continue expanding the LNGOs' network of development partners and providing capacity-building assistance to the new partners through supporting their initiatives in the economic growth sector) include: (1) increasing funding opportunities for LNGOs' economic development initiatives regardless of the funding source (USAID/BiH Mission's country budget in the economic development sector has so far not been used for LNGO prime awards); (2) matching funding levels for LNGOs to the level of their present absorption capacity and including implementers' program management and absorption capacity building in funded interventions' objectives, through gradual increase of amounts of awards to local prime NGO implementers as absorption capacity is built; (3) augmenting EDO's resources/resource division to ensure adequate resources to manage multiple awards to local prime NGO implementers and building of their capacities; (4) improving pre-award assessment tools and processes to focus more on technical and programmatic capacities of potential implementers in addition to financial and administrative capacities; and (5) improving the awards' risk management system.&nbsp; (Author abstract, modified)",Footer title: Evaluation of the 2010-2013 USAID/BIH DGP ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Bosnia and Herzegovina monitoring and evaluation support (MEASURE-BiH),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-168-C-14-00003,,11/1/2017 0:00,,Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Economic growth ~|~_©_~|~ Funding mechanisms ~|~_©_~|~ Local capacity building ~|~_©_~|~ Financial resources ~|~_©_~|~ Strategic objectives,Bosnia and Hercegovina,168-A-00-10-00105-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-168-A-00-10-00105 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-168-A-11-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-168-A-11-00005 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-168-F-13-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00N5VQ.pdf,1147 KB,"041024 - IMPAQ International, LLC",,009954 - USAID.

PA-00N-3ZQ,"The United States Agency for International Development/Sri Lanka launched the Supporting Opportunities for Livelihoods Development (SOLID) activity in 2013 to increase economic opportunities for vulnerable families in target provinces of Sri Lanka.&nbsp; This mixed-methods, final-performance evaluation focuses on the following: (1) how effective SOLID was in achieving the project's intended outcomes; (2) whether project activities influenced USG and Government of Sri Lanka (GoSL) relations; (3) if there were any intended or unintended effects on agricultural value chains and their sustainability; and (4) if, and how, beneficiaries are implementing skills and techniques taught by the project.&nbsp; Overall, SOLID improved agricultural output in all three of the target regions evaluated and in all three target sectors (dairy, horticulture, and poultry).&nbsp; This output was achieved in part by deploying effective techniques and technologies derived from commercial value chains, such as silage.&nbsp; SOLID succeeded in engaging women in agriculture and in providing access to productive assets, but SOLID's success was more mixed with respect to engaging youth.&nbsp; SOLID significantly improved household income and generated positive changes in household nutrition due to increased income generated by farming activities.&nbsp; The relationship between SOLID and the GoSL was characterized more by coordination and support, with limited influence on relevant GoSL activities and approaches.&nbsp; SOLID had limited partnerships with previous USG projects/activities and with other donors working in this space.&nbsp; Finally, the vast majority of past beneficiaries are currently implementing the skills and techniques promoted by SOLID, and most farmers involved in demonstration activities have adopted recommended practices.&nbsp; (Author abstract)",Evaluated task order title: Supporting opportunities for livelihoods development (SOLID) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: USAID Asia learning and M&E support ~|~_©_~|~ Project title also known as: Asia learning and monitoring and evaluation (ALME),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-383-TO-17-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-486-I-14-00001,,10/1/2017 0:00,,Livelihood ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Employment ~|~_©_~|~ Income generation ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural economics ~|~_©_~|~ Value chains ~|~_©_~|~ Dairy farms ~|~_©_~|~ Horticulture ~|~_©_~|~ Poultry ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural development,Sri Lanka,AID-OAA-M-12-00008,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00N3ZQ.pdf,1562 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008606 - USAID.

PA-00M-ZJ3,"This report is a performance evaluation of the Incident Command System (ICS) program in Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand managed by the United States Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA). &nbsp;The evaluation examined the program's effectiveness and sustainability in building the capacity of local government agencies in the three countries to respond to natural disaster using ICS. &nbsp;The evaluation applied a mixed methods design, collecting data from document reviews, key informant interviews, focus group discussions, and an online survey for ICS master trainers in the Philippines. &nbsp;Results show that the programs have identified the appropriate local government agencies to work with and ICS capacities are being built to varying degrees. &nbsp;Demand for training is high but USAID/OFDA and the United States Forest Service (USFS) trainers must consider contextualizing ICS principles and training content to make the system relevant to local agencies and communities. &nbsp;USAID/OFDA and USFS trainers also should consider conditions unique to each country, such as governance structures, to solicit the support of the local first responders' community. &nbsp;The effectiveness and sustainability will also be better understood if local government agencies develop performance management plans to track the program's effectiveness and sustainability. &nbsp;(Author abstract)","A Performance Evaluation of the ICS System in Thailand Covering the Assistance Provided by USAID/OFDA from 2011 ~|~_©_~|~ Also known as: USAID OFDA ICS final evaluation report ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) ~|~_©_~|~ Indonesia country report: PA-00M-ZHZ ~|~_©_~|~ Philippines country report: PA-00M-ZJ1 ~|~_©_~|~ Thailand country report: PA-00M-ZJ2",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-TO-16-00037 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-15-00018,,8/1/2017 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Disaster management ~|~_©_~|~ Disaster response ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Knowledge ~|~_©_~|~ Local level ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion ~|~_©_~|~ Trainees,Thailand ~|~_©_~|~ Philippines ~|~_©_~|~ Indonesia,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MZJ3.pdf,1597 KB,"009054 - DevTech Systems, Inc.",,"000624 - USAID.

PA-00M-Z6B,"Since its creation in 2009, USAID's rule of law program in Haiti, PROJUSTICE, has worked to enhance justice delivery as a basis for establishing stability and security and improving citizens' confidence in Haitian government institutions.&nbsp; One activity of this program has been the provision of legal assistance in order to reduce the rate of prolonged pre-trial detention (PTD) in Haitian prisons.&nbsp; Prolonged PTD constitutes a prevalent human rights abuse in Haiti: over 70% of individuals in Haitian prisons are held in this illegal form of detention.&nbsp; This impact evaluation seeks to evaluate the effectiveness of PROJUSTICE's legal assistance program in prisons in Port au Prince and Croix des Bouquets.&nbsp; Given the large populations of pre-trial detainees in these jurisdictions, PROJUSTICE legal assistants will be unable to provide assistance to all detainees before the expiration of the program in 2016.&nbsp; By randomizing the order in which legal assistance is provided to current pre-trial detainees, we will be able to estimate the causal impact of PROJUSTICE legal assistance on the trajectory of the cases of those subjects held in prolonged PTD and quantify the impact of legal assistance on rates of PTD in Haiti.&nbsp; We also intend to track a number of secondary outcomes through baseline and endline surveys.&nbsp; Overall, the results from this impact evaluation will be of interest to local stake holders in civil society and the government, such as the Ministry of Justice and the Superior Council of the Judiciary (CSPJ), in addition to the academic community and the many human rights advocate, monitoring groups, and NGOs that work on similar issues of justice internationally.&nbsp; (Author abstract)","""Contract No. GS-10F-0033M/AID-OAA-M-13-00013"" ~|~_©_~|~ Tasking 031 ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Improving justice service delivery and sector reform in Haiti (PROJUSTICE) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: DRG learning, evaluation, and research (DRG-LER)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-M-13-00013,,4/1/2017 0:00,,Households ~|~_©_~|~ Lawyers ~|~_©_~|~ Litigation ~|~_©_~|~ Ports ~|~_©_~|~ Prisons ~|~_©_~|~ Socioeconomic status ~|~_©_~|~ Subjects (experimental) ~|~_©_~|~ Surveys,Haiti,521-C-00-09-00018-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-521-C-00-09-00018,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MZ6B.pdf,1490 KB,040818 - NORC at the University of Chicago,,"Project title: DRG learning, evaluation, and research (DRG-LER)",English,application/pdf,,,"Slough, Tara ~|~_©_~|~ Fariss, Christopher",Rule of law,21-Apr-17,,,,Impact evaluation of USAID Haiti PROJUSTICE program pretrial detention component,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=MjMxODQ2,Haiti,,,2017-04-01,2017,HTI,HTI_2017,0.043036851837010004,0.5077883011933879,0.8254963427377221,,,0.111111111111111,,0.16518898140637697,0.087598471135695,0.128254143783861,0.27014755959137304,,,0.651299909729467,0.396324100440073,0.25925925925925897,0.582116788321168,HTI,2017,2.0,0.280547282260147,3.0,0.37498362989225276,PAK_2013,PAK_2017,BGD_2016,PAK_2016,PAK_2018

PA-00M-XVM,"This report presents the results of a final performance evaluation of the Partnership for Growth (PFG) in El Salvador, a shared development framework promoting economic growth. &nbsp;The evaluation used desk review and interview data to answer three questions: (1) what has been the overall impact of PFG in El Salvador, and how did the various lines of action contribute to this outcome?; (2) how did the PFG approach affect the bilateral relationship -- including U.S. Government (USG) and Government of El Salvador program implementation and dialogue -- in each partner country, both in intended and unintended ways?; (3) what best practices and lessons can be learned from the PFG approach to: (a) apply to the bilateral relationship in El Salvador and (b) apply to future USG assistance efforts worldwide? The evaluation team concludes that PFG enabled legislative reform, established new institutions, and supported international agreements. &nbsp;PFG's approach strengthened bilateral cooperation, improved trust, and directed greater attention to priority issues. &nbsp;Challenges included the lack of new funding and an excessive number of goals. &nbsp;There were mixed opinions on the scorecard completion process, and concern that PFG was overly optimistic regarding its potential for effecting change. &nbsp;The evaluation recommends that U.S. participation in the Growth Council continue, and the council expand to include other actors. &nbsp;Future multiagency collaborations of this type should empower leadership at the highest levels, and include more coordination resources and centralized recordkeeping. &nbsp;Similar activities should include the host government at the planning and reporting stages to encourage higher levels of participation. &nbsp;(Author abstract, modified)","""March 20, 2017 (Revised July 24, 2017)"" ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: E3 analytics and evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Spanish ed.: PA-00N-1HH ~|~_©_~|~ Mid-term evaluation: PA-00K-B8W",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-M-13-00017,,7/1/2017 0:00,,Economic growth ~|~_©_~|~ Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Policy reform ~|~_©_~|~ Constraints ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Business formation ~|~_©_~|~ Business growth ~|~_©_~|~ Development assistance,El Salvador,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MXVM.pdf,712 KB,"003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

PA-00M-VZX,"USAID's Office of Population and Reproductive Health's flagship implementation science project, the Evidence Project, was awarded in September 2013 as a five-plus-five-year cooperative agreement. &nbsp;To inform decisions about future programming, the USAID management team supported a performance evaluation through the Global Health Program Cycle Improvement Project (GH Pro). &nbsp;A three-person evaluation team, including one external consultant and two USAID staff members, conducted an evaluation, between January and April 2017, that included interviews with 95 key informants, review of project documents, and visits to Nigeria, Senegal, and Uganda. &nbsp;The Evidence Project has more than 50 activities in 16 countries and is designed to generate new evidence, synthesize and share existing evidence, and increase use of evidence. &nbsp;Most respondents noted that the Evidence Project had a slow and shaky start, but that there is now a strong team and a significantly improved situation. &nbsp;The Evidence Project has produced some valuable reports and is conducting important research on a wide range of topics from task-sharing to expanding access for youth and measuring rights-based family planning. &nbsp;However, there are still tensions between the project and USAID, stemming from the early years of the project, and the team heard concerns regarding the quality of some products and research utilization (RU) efforts that focused on process more than outcomes. &nbsp;Therefore, the evaluation team suggests the project prioritize completion of its existing work, along with a focus on RU and handoff, to ensure important RU outcomes. &nbsp;(Author abstract)",Evaluation assignment no. 343 ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Evidence project ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health program cycle improvement (GH pro),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,,5/1/2017 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Gender equality ~|~_©_~|~ Planning ~|~_©_~|~ Reproductive health ~|~_©_~|~ Research utilization ~|~_©_~|~ Youth,Africa south of Sahara,AID-OAA-A-13-00087,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MVZX.pdf,1599 KB,040668 - Dexis Consulting Group,,011262 - USAID.

PA-00M-R5Q,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/Tanzania established the Tibu Homa project to: (1) increase availability and accessibility of fundamental facility-based curative and preventive child health services; (2) ensure sustainability of critical child health activities; and (3) increase linkages with the community to promote healthy behaviors and increase knowledge and use of child health services.&nbsp; Tibu Homa's components were training for healthcare workers on integrated management of childhood illnesses (IMCI), quality improvement, supply chain management, and supportive supervision and mentorship.&nbsp; MEASURE Evaluation was asked to conduct a performance evaluation to estimate the association between (1) the training modalities and (2) supportive components implemented by the Tibu Homa project with quality of care (QOC).&nbsp; The evaluation used a retrospective, mixed-methods approach drawing from a cross-sectional quantitative health facility survey, qualitative and costing data collection, secondary time series data, and project document review.&nbsp; The IMCI score was the primary outcome of the study.&nbsp; Evaluation results indicate the training modality was not associated with different levels of QOC as measured by the IMCI score.&nbsp; The QOC on this measure improved significantly over the course of the project regardless of training modality, but dropped by the time of follow-up.&nbsp; One year after the project ended, Tibu Homa facilities had higher QOC for all cases measured by the IMCI score, and higher rates of correct classification and treatment for pneumonia cases than did a group of comparison facilities.&nbsp; Both Tibu Homa and comparison facilities performed well on accurate classification and treatment of malaria cases.&nbsp; (Author abstract)",Footer title: Tibu homa project performance evaluation report ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Tibu homa ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: MEASURE evaluation phase IV,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-L-14-00004,,5/1/2017 0:00,,Child survival activities ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Child health care ~|~_©_~|~ Health behavior ~|~_©_~|~ Health workers ~|~_©_~|~ Integrated management ~|~_©_~|~ Pneumonia ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services,Tanzania,AID-621-A-00-11-00011 ~|~_©_~|~ 621-A-00-11-00011-00,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MR5Q.pdf,2345 KB,000821 - University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

PA-00M-PKN,"The Expanded Social Marketing Project in Nigeria (ESMPIN) is a five-year social marketing project funded by USAID/Nigeria to reduce maternal, and child morbidity and mortality and increase affordable family planning modern methods to Nigeria couples. &nbsp;The evaluation focuses on five questions: effectiveness of strategies, sustainability of strategies, evaluation of results, cost analysis, and gender conducted under the program. &nbsp;ESMPN is managed by The Society for Family Health (SFH), a Nigerian non-governmental organization that has implemented social marketing programs in Nigeria since the 1990s. &nbsp;Its partners for this award are Population Services International (PSI), British Broadcasting Corporation Media Action, and the Association of Reproductive and Family Health (ARFH), and the project worked in 22 states in Nigeria. &nbsp;ESMPIN was successful in building commodity-security, showing a reduction in stock-out rate from 30% to 15%. &nbsp;Although the program invested heavily in independent detailing and distribution networks, these are not sustainable operations without heavy funding from donors or outside sources. &nbsp;Cost analysis and primary research show the return on investment for the interpersonal communication agents in the South to be very low at about 2%, costing $3.321 million per Cycle (180 communities). &nbsp;ESMPIN conducted several pilot programs, including one with chemists, Proprietary Patent Medicine Vendors, and a public-private partnership with the Chi Pharmaceutical Ltd., manufacturer of an oral rehydration solution and Zinc. &nbsp;After $57 million and almost six years of implementation, Couple Years of Protection (CYPs) in 2011 for medium- and long-acting reversible contraceptive methods, (e.g., implants injectables, and IUDs) were 28.2% of the baseline CYP while over the five-year time frame by the end of ESMPIN (2016) the CYPs for these same products had increased only 0.1% to 28.3% CYPs. &nbsp;(Author abstract)",Evaluation assignment number: 246 ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Expanded social marketing project in Nigeria (ESMPIN) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health program cycle improvement (GH pro),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,,3/1/2017 0:00,,Social marketing ~|~_©_~|~ Family planning services ~|~_©_~|~ Health care costs ~|~_©_~|~ Gender equality ~|~_©_~|~ Investment promotion ~|~_©_~|~ Distribution ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Reproductive health,Nigeria,AID-620-A-11-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MPKN.pdf,2067 KB,040668 - Dexis Consulting Group,,"040224 - USAID.

PA-00M-NMM,"The objectives of this final evaluation were to: (1) identify the contribution of the USAID supported Amazon Malaria Initiative (AMI) to the ability of eleven partner countries' National Malaria Control Programs to control malaria from 2001-2015; (2) evaluate the capabilities of partner countries to address the changing scenarios of malaria transmission; and, (3) identify the main challenges that countries may face while confronting new scenarios of malaria transmission as well as the challenges that should be addressed by international cooperation agencies.&nbsp; The evaluation used a mixed analytical approach incorporating qualitative and quantitative methods.&nbsp; The qualitative component included in-depth interviews with key informants, content analysis of selected documents, and case studies from four partner countries.&nbsp; The quantitative component included the analysis of data obtained from epidemiological databases on malaria and the review of selected documents.&nbsp; AMI partner countries have shown a substantial but heterogeneous reduction of malaria cases since the year 2001, including some setbacks and slower progress in later years, especially the last four.&nbsp; Partner countries have achieved substantial progress and developed important capabilities in all six of the AMI Program technical focus areas.&nbsp; AMI supported capacity development that addressed country-specific malaria control needs and scenarios.&nbsp; The program served as a platform for inter-country collaboration, introducing innovations and strengthening information systems through national communication strategies and alliances.&nbsp; Key capacities for malaria control have been built and enhanced, and these continue to respond to changing epidemiological scenarios.&nbsp; However, there is a need to make improvements, such as better planning and monitoring of activities including alignment to PAHO&acute;s strategy, in order to consolidate progress and prevent the reintroduction of malaria.&nbsp; The principal recommendation of this evaluation is to maintain the progress to date.&nbsp; Malaria elimination is still in the distant future, and it is more important to continue building strong programs, overcome current and upcoming crises and prevent re-emergence in settings where malaria is under control.&nbsp; The control of malaria is not exclusive to the national level, but instead requires a regional agenda meriting support from the international cooperation, as PAHO, in coordination with partner countries.&nbsp; (Author abstract)",Cover date: Diciembre 2016 ~|~_©_~|~ Translated title provided by submitter ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Amazon malaria initiative (AMI) ~|~_©_~|~ Mid-term evaluation (in English): PA-00K-8CZ,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-527-C-13-00002,,3/1/2017 0:00,,Malaria ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Disease treatment ~|~_©_~|~ Drug resistance ~|~_©_~|~ Antimalarials ~|~_©_~|~ Disease surveillance ~|~_©_~|~ Medical laboratories ~|~_©_~|~ Information dissemination ~|~_©_~|~ Morbidity,Latin America ~|~_©_~|~ Andean region ~|~_©_~|~ Central America,AID-527-A-12-00006,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MNMM.pdf,1998 KB,"013010 - Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH) ~|~_©_~|~ 040772 - Partners for Global Research and Development, LLC (PGRD)",,008591 - USAID.

PA-00M-HCR,"This evaluation analyzes the contribution of the Peru Bosques Project (PPB) to the progress made in fulfilling the Environmental Chapter and the Forest Sector Governance Annex of the United States-Peru Trade Promotion Agreement (PTPA). &nbsp;The evaluation focuses specifically on: (1) contributions to the institutional strengthening of the forestry sector; (2) capacity building in forest management; (3) monitoring, control, and supervision of illegal logging; and (4) to the sustainable use of the forest by the private sector and indigenous communities. &nbsp;The evaluation employs a mixed-methods approach that includes primary qualitative data gathered in Lima, Madre de Dios, Loreto and Ucayali. &nbsp;Main findings suggest that the PPB contributed substantially to the consolidation of the institutional reforms in the forestry sector through three important results: (1) support for the creation and implementation of the National Forestry and Wildlife Service (SERFOR); (2) improvement to the viability of the prior consultation process for the new regulations for the Forestry and Wildlife Law; and (3) in the customized design of the Regional Environmental Authorities (ARAs) for the regional governments of Loreto, Madre de Dios, and Ucayali. &nbsp;The PPB intervened successfully with the private sector, which is a key ally in the fight against illegal logging and for the sustainable use of forests. &nbsp;The intervention involved the participation of indigenous organizations in the first regulatory consultation process and the training of community stakeholders to protect the forest. &nbsp;However, there is a lack of capacity building at the community level. &nbsp;Capacity building efforts among civil servants were hampered by a lack of political will and the slow implementation of the civil service law. &nbsp;The evaluation recommends: (1) strengthening the coordination and transparency functions of the governing body of the National Forestry and Wildlife System; (2) institutionalizing capacity building on environmental and forest management issues with regional governments; (3) promoting community forest management with indigenous organizations; and (4) promoting incentives within a value chain approach for the legalization and formalization of timber and non-timber forest activities. &nbsp;(Author abstract, modified)","""Ultima revision: Diciembre 28, 2016"" ~|~_©_~|~ Translated title provided by cataloguer ~|~_©_~|~ Abstract and executive summary also in English ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Proyecto Peru bosques  (PPB)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-527-C-13-00002,,11/1/2016 0:00,,Forestry ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Natural resource management ~|~_©_~|~ Monitoring ~|~_©_~|~ Logging ~|~_©_~|~ Sustainable development ~|~_©_~|~ Private sector ~|~_©_~|~ Indigenous populations ~|~_©_~|~ Local capacity building ~|~_©_~|~ Wildlife resources ~|~_©_~|~ Crime prevention ~|~_©_~|~ Incentives,Peru,AID-527-C-11-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00MHCR.pdf,1253 KB,"012146 - Grupo de Analisis para el Desarrollo (GRADE) ~|~_©_~|~ 040772 - Partners for Global Research and Development, LLC (PGRD)",,008591 - USAID.

PB-AAF-123,"<p class=""MsoNormal"">This report evaluates the performance of the Climate Resiliency of Kazakhstan Wheat and Central Asian Food Security (CRW) project.&nbsp; The $2.2 million project was aimed at improving Kazakhstan's collection, analysis, dissemination and use of weather and climate information, including forecasting, and give farmers techniques to adapt to climate change.&nbsp; It also aimed to launch a regional dialogue on wheat, climate change and regional food security.&nbsp; Kazakhstan is a major wheat producer and the largest grain producer under predominantly rain-fed conditions in the world.&nbsp; Farmers are facing more droughts due to higher temperatures and more climate variability.&nbsp; The evaluation found mixed results in terms of improving the government's ability to collect and analyze agrometeorological data and making seasonal and climate predictions.&nbsp; As one example, the project has led to better drought, crop and climate assessments, but seasonal climate forecasts have seen only marginal gains.&nbsp; Regarding dissemination, it found few farmers receive monthly agricultural bulletins created by the Ministry of Agriculture.&nbsp; The fees required may impede this.&nbsp; The evaluation also covered whether farmers are adopting climate-resilient techniques and whether the project addressed key climate challenges and gender concerns.&nbsp; It listed 26 recommendations for subsequent projects and further steps the government could take.&nbsp; (ClimateLinks.org)&nbsp;</p>",Footer title: Final evaluation report - performance evaluation : CRW project ~|~_©_~|~ Also known as: Iimproving the climate resiliency of Kazakhstan wheat and Central Asian food security project : final performance evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: E3 analytics and evaluation,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-M-13-00017,,12/1/2015 0:00,,Climate change ~|~_©_~|~ Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Resilience ~|~_©_~|~ Weather ~|~_©_~|~ Farmers ~|~_©_~|~ Farmer training ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural innovations ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural adaptation ~|~_©_~|~ Wheat ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural production,Kazakhstan,AID-176-IO-14-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PBAAF123.pdf,2036 KB,"011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

PA-00W-4BW,"<div>USAID-funded Strengthening High Impact Interventions for an AIDS-free Generation (AIDSFree) Project, works to scale-up Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC) in high HIV prevalence countries. This evaluation examined VMMC-associated adverse events (AEs), AE documentation, reporting and management practices, and mechanisms for identifying, reporting, and preventing AEs in three AIDSFree countries: Malawi, Namibia, and Tanzania. In Namibia and Tanzania, data on VMMC AEs were abstracted from medical records in clinics supported by AIDSFree. In all three countries key informant interviews were conducted and project documents were reviewed. In Namibia, medical records were found to be largely complete, but in Tanzania that data quality and chart completeness varied considerably. There was underreporting of moderate and severe AEs in both countries. Interview respondents in Malawi, Namibia, and Tanzania understood AE reporting and documentation mechanisms, but respondents in all three countries voiced concern that reporting of AEs might exclude them from future VMMC work. Prevention strategies focused on postoperative AEs, as patients often have limited understanding of wound care and hygiene, despite extensive counseling. Risk factor analysis was limited to Namibia over concerns of data quality in Tanzania. In Namibia, postoperative AEs were twice as likely as intraoperative AEs and the highest postoperative AE rate was observed among 15- to 24-year-olds.<br /><br /></div> <div>Recommendations included:</div> <div> Training of clinic staff should emphasize appropriate documentation and charting of AEs, along with VMMC clinical skills and AE management.</div> <div> VMMC implementing partners should conduct routine data quality assessment with data validation to improve documentation.</div> <div> Increased emphasis should be placed on postoperative wound management, care, and hygiene</div>",Evaluated task order title: AIDS-free generation (AIDSFree) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global Health Program Cycle Improvement Project (GH Pro),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,,9/1/2019 0:00,,AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Age ~|~_©_~|~ Circumcision ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Documentation ~|~_©_~|~ Hygiene ~|~_©_~|~ Infections ~|~_©_~|~ Male,Namibia ~|~_©_~|~ Tanzania ~|~_©_~|~ Malawi,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00W4BW.pdf,2839 KB,"011976 - QED Group, LLC ~|~_©_~|~ 040668 - Dexis Consulting Group",,010929 - USAID.

PA-00T-XWW,"Social Impact, Inc. conducted an ex-post performance evaluation of the Mai Munisipiu Program (MMP), implemented in Timor-Leste by Counterpart International. The purpose of the evaluation was to explore how sustainable results have been since the programs conclusion in 2017. The evaluation questions addressed the extent to which Suco (village) councils, legal aid organizations, and district courts retained skills from MMP training; outcomes in human and institutional capacity of Suco councils; whether the design of MMP was appropriate for the countrys context; and the extent to which community members agree that women can be effective leaders. The evaluation included a document review; 45 semi-structured key informant interviews; four focus group discussions; and a rapid survey of 50 citizens. <br /><br />The evaluation concluded: Suco councils retained proposal writing skills. The comprehensiveness of the training curriculum and follow-up mentoring facilitated retention; Suco councils improved their administration, but equivalent gains were not made in other areas. The turnover of elected council members after elections in 2016 is a threat to the sustainability of the capacity that was built; community members believe that women can be effective leaders in theory, but in practice they prefer male leaders; court and legal aid actors retained little from the training due to their base capacity level and the limited volume of training provided; and program efforts did not result in an increase in basic services to citizens, but they laid a foundation that can be built upon.",Evaluated task order title: Mai munisipiu program (MMP) formerly known as ba distrito (to the districts) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: USAID Asia learning and monitoring &evaluation support,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-486-I-14-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ 72047219F00001,,7/1/2019 0:00,,Courts ~|~_©_~|~ Elections ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Judicial reform ~|~_©_~|~ Local level ~|~_©_~|~ Political participation ~|~_©_~|~ Voting ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Timor-Leste,AID-486-A-13-00007,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TXWW.pdf,1455 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,011939 - USAID.

PA-00T-XVR,"<p class=""p1"">The USAID-supported Mayer Hashi Phase II (MH-II) project, implemented during October 2013 through September 2018 aimed to increase the use of effective family planning (FP) and reproductive health services, with a focus on the informed and voluntary use of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) and permanent methods (PMs). This external impact evaluation was conducted by MEASURE Evaluation to determine the impact of the MH-II project on LARC and PM use at the population level. The evaluation used household, provider, and facility surveys conducted in 2015 and 2017 in early (Phase I) and late (Phase III) implementation districts supplemented by qualitative interviews with district family planning managers in 2017 to contextualize results.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class=""p1"">There were no increases in LARC and PM use or in intention to use LARCs and PMs at the population level in Mayer Hashi Phase I or Phase III program areas by 2017. The percentage of providers who were trained in LARCs and PMs and PPFP increased notably in both Phase I and Phase III areas, but changes in intermediate outcomes hypothesized along the program pathway were not realized. Contextual analysis identified chronic system weaknesses in provision of LARCs and PMs outside of the scope of the MH-II project and persistent low demand for LARCs and PMs as impediments to widespread increases in the use of LARCs and PMs. Future programs focusing on LARCs and PMs need to consider these larger system constraints in their design and in setting their expected outcomes. They also need to further engage the private sector given its growing role in health care.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p>",Evaluated task order title: Mayer hashi II ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: MEASURE evaluation phase II,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-L-14-00004,,8/1/2019 0:00,,Age ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Family health care ~|~_©_~|~ Planning ~|~_©_~|~ Questionnaires ~|~_©_~|~ Reproduction ~|~_©_~|~ Surveys ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Bangladesh,AID-388-LA-13-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TXVR.pdf,7698 KB,000891 - University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,,010929 - USAID.

This</div> <div>framework became self-sustaining and can be replicated in other countries. The original goal of creating an</div> <div>institution that would become a single national bond bank was set aside. Instead, the activity supported the</div> <div>creation of the legal framework for a mechanismthe bond bank/Special Purpose Vehicle (BB/SPV) toolthat</div> <div>can be used at a national, state, or municipal level. Two state bond banks were created, in Hidalgo and Quintana</div> <div>Roo. The capacity building goal was partially completed. High personnel turnover at the local government level,</div> <div>when national government administrations change, is a constraint for creating a sustained workforce of staff</div> <div>trained in the use of the tool. The work of the last years of the activity restructured the debt for the state of</div> <div>Veracruz and introduced a new special purpose financing vehicle, the Accredited Trust.

PA-00T-WSN,"In 2014, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funded the KNCV Tuberculosis Foundation, Management Sciences for Health and the World Health Organization to implement the five-year Challenge TB (CTB) Activity to support Ethiopias National Tuberculosis Program (NTP) in reducing TB incidence and related deaths by providing capacity building and technical assistance to the government, agencies, and health facilities to strengthen program management and service delivery. USAID/Ethiopia contracted Social Impact, Inc. to conduct a performance evaluation to examine Activity effectiveness, intervention challenges, and provide recommendations to guide decisions on future TB activity design and implementation. The evaluation team used mixed methods including document review, secondary data analysis, key informant interviews, and observations to identify findings that addressed USAIDs evaluation questions. The evaluation found that the range and reach of CTB interventions and technical assistance were comprehensive, high quality, and responsive to NTP needs. However, design and implementation challenges impeded efficiency (implementation delays, lack of depth in use of data for decision making), and effectiveness (variability in adherence to standards for case finding, treatment, and community-based interventions). While CTB excelled in supporting the expansion of critical diagnostic services, management of drug-resistant TB, and research, there was evidence of inconsistent practice of active case finding.

PA-00T-W5X,"This final whole-of-project evaluation of the Local Governance Project (LGP) examines the soundness of the LGP theory of change, collaboration among USAID implementing mechanisms, and possible adjustments to USAID/Ukraines approach to supporting local governance in Ukraine. LGP was launched in 2015 with three activities: Policy for Ukraine Local Self-Governance (PULSE), Decentralization Offering Better Results and Efficiency (DOBRE), and Municipal Finance Strengthening Initiative-II (MFSI-II). Using a mixed-methods approach, the evaluation team reviewed relevant documents, surveyed key informants and residents of assisted municipalities, and interviewed 156 key informants during three weeks of fieldwork in 21 municipalities across seven oblasts. The evaluation concluded that the development hypothesis is largely valid and could be further refined. LGP helped to strengthen local governance in Ukraine through its three activities and made significant progress toward realizing expected results. USAID/Ukraine provided support for creating a legal basis for consolidation; providing technical advice for central, regional, and local authorities; and introducing practical models and tools at the municipal level. However, there was not close cooperation between the two main activities, PULSE and DOBRE, in helping local governments manage resources and services effectively. Additional support in development and adoption of the local governance strategy is needed, and the evaluation identifies five areas for future assistance. This report concludes with 17 recommendations for future USAID support for local governance in Ukraine, including further support for decentralization legislation and municipal capacity development; better coordination between USAID implementers and with other donors; and expanding LGP support to more municipalities.","On title page: Submitted August 1, 2019 ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order title: Local governance project (LGP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Democracy, rights, and governance - learning, evaluation, and research (DRG-LER) ~|~_©_~|~ COR: Andrew Greer",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-M-13-00011 ~|~_©_~|~ GS-10F-0294V,,8/1/2019 0:00,,Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Decentralization ~|~_©_~|~ Economic growth ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Local level ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Transparency ~|~_©_~|~ Youth,Ukraine,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TW5X.pdf,2432 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,"040194 - USAID.

PA-00T-TP5,"Implemented between September 2012 and January 2019, the USAID-funded Lebanon Industry Value Chain Development (LIVCD) project sought to develop inclusive and competitive value chains in rural areas of the country to help increase the income of the population there, including micro, small, and medium enterprises. The evaluation examines the projects relevance, efficiency and cost-effectiveness, effectiveness, sustainability, and additionality. It provides conclusions and recommendations to inform future activities and follow-on actions. The methods employed included a document review, 64 key-informant interviews, 28 focus group discussions (with 221 individuals), and direct observations.<br /><br /> <div>LIVCDs performance varied according to the targeted value chain. Interventions with avocado and olive farmers were the most cost-effective, while those with apple and cherry farmers were the least cost-effective. Significant contextual challenges hindered LIVCDs performance. However, the evaluation found evidence of improved incomes and competitiveness for avocado, olive, and grape farmers in addition to processed-food companies. There was limited or no income improvement for LIVCD-supported apple and cherry farmers. The total value of loans raised was considerable. However, access to finance improved for 102 beneficiaries only and was rather the result of investments leveraged by grants and technical assistance than that of activities aimed at promoting access to finance. Additionality was evident when new technologies or techniques were introduced. The project design included aspects related to ensuring sustainability. However, without further improvements in the quality of the produce, the interventions sustainability is at risk, especially in the apple value chain.</div>",Evaluated task order title: Lebanon industry value chain development (LIVCD) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Performance management and support program for Lebanon (PMSPL II),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-268-C-15-00001,,11/1/2018 0:00,,Apples ~|~_©_~|~ Avocados ~|~_©_~|~ Cherries ~|~_©_~|~ Grapes ~|~_©_~|~ Honey ~|~_©_~|~ Olives ~|~_©_~|~ Rural areas ~|~_©_~|~ Value chains,Lebanon,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TTP5.pdf,1311 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008568 - USAID.

PA-00T-T9R,"<div>Data for Development conducted a post-performance evaluation of the United States Agency for International Development Tanzanias (USAID/Tanzania) Capacity Development for Partners of Accountability (CPDA) Activity, or Pamoja Twajenga (PT) (Together we Build in Kiswahili) in late 2018. The activity, implemented by Chemonics from July 2013 to July 2017, supported the Missions grants to Tanzanian institutions of accountability (IoAs) and civil society organizations (CSOs), as well as other CSOs. PT provided capacity building support to improve constructive citizen-government engagement.<br /><br /></div> <div>The evaluation team (ET) used a mixed-methods approach through document and data review and key informant interviews to answer five evaluation questions. The ET found that PTs partners identified improved and constructive citizen/government engagement that had occurred over the course of the program. The ET found that the technical support provided to USAIDs CSO partners met the needs and priorities of the Mission in its management of CSO grant activities. Performance management data demonstrated that PT met or almost met its targets for capacity strengthening of CSOs, while IoA targets were not met as two of the three IoA partners had limited years of engagement with the project. The ET found that capacity developed with the support of PT has been sustained as long as CSOs have the financial resources. Stakeholders are largely satisfied with the performance of the contractor in training and providing TA. The evaluation makes recommendations for the Mission for any future capacity development support to CSOs or Government of Tanzania partners.</div>","Evaluated project title: Capacity development for partners of accountability (CPDA) also known as pamoja twajenga (PT) ""together we build in Kiswahili""",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-621-TO-17-00005 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-15-00024,,3/1/2019 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluation ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Organizational capacity ~|~_©_~|~ Rule of law ~|~_©_~|~ USAID ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Tanzania,AID-621-C-13-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TT9R.pdf,1040 KB,008414 - ME&A,,008612 - USAID.

The lack of positive impact may be due to factors including (1) weaknesses in the activity design, particularly its theory of change, (2) political polarization in pilot municipalities, which MCCS could not overcome (in part due to weaknesses in its theory of change), (3) institutional weaknesses inherent in Macedonias system of municipal government, and (4) issues related to activity implementation.</span></div> </div>",Evaluated task order title: Municipal climate change strategies (MCCS) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: E3 analytics and evaluation,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-M-13-00017 ~|~_©_~|~ GS-23F-8012H,,4/1/2017 0:00,,Afforestation ~|~_©_~|~ Attitude ~|~_©_~|~ Climate change ~|~_©_~|~ Demonstration ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Social sciences ~|~_©_~|~ Water sanitation,North Macedonia,AID-165-A-12-00008,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TPQF.pdf,2423 KB,"011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

The evaluation further confirmed the use, in important instances, of data generated through the project to inform policy decisions on citizen security-related issues in each of the three countries.<br /><br />Among key recommendations are the need for: the design and implementation of training programs in the fields of official crime statistics, survey sampling, crime measurement scales, crime analysis for crime investigation and evaluation of crime prevention policies; and the strengthening of analytical capacity for evidence-based policymaking within relevant institutions.</span>",Evaluated project title: Regional citizen security project (InfoSegura),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-I-15-00024 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-519-TO-16-00002,,1/1/2019 0:00,,Civic education ~|~_©_~|~ Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Crimes ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Security ~|~_©_~|~ Violence,Central America,AID-596-IO-14-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TPB8.pdf,884 KB,008414 - ME&A,,008540 - USAID.

PA-00T-P84,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/Ethiopia designed the Strengthening Ethiopias Urban Health (SEUH) Activity to support the Government of Ethiopias (GoE) Urban Health Extension Program (UHEP) by improving the quality of urban health services, strengthening referral linkages, building the institutional and technical capacity of regional health bureaus, and promoting intersectoral collaboration on urban health challenges. Using a mixed-methods approach, this final performance evaluation examines SEUH design, implementation, effectiveness, and sustainability. The evaluation findings and recommendations can guide the U.S. government in its allocation of resources to support UHEP. <br /><br />Findings show that the design of SEUH was aligned with UHEP prioritieshygiene and environmental health; family health; disease prevention and control; and injury prevention and control, first aid, and referral servicesand responded to most UHEP needs. However, SEUHs design lacked a strategy for the health needs of the homeless urban poor and of youth and adolescents and did not sufficiently address interventions for noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). SEUHs main contributions to supporting UHEP included human resource capacity building, quality improvement, demand creation, and regional platforms strengthening and establishing WASH platforms. SEUH contributed extensively to improving the health system for the housed urban poor and increasing the demand and delivery of health services. Except for the integrated refresher training of health workers which has been shifted to the government, the evaluation concluded that at the time of the evaluation, most of the SEUH strategies were not sustainable by the government without donor funding.",Evaluated project  title: Strengthening Ethiopias urban health (SEUH),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-663-C-16-00010,,2/1/2019 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Access to services ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Family health care ~|~_©_~|~ Hygiene ~|~_©_~|~ Poor ~|~_©_~|~ Sanitation education ~|~_©_~|~ Water sanitation,Ethiopia,AID-663-A-13-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TP84.pdf,2799 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008543 - USAID.

PA-00T-NS2,"This evaluation assesses the transferability and sustainability of the Healthy Communities and Municipalities II model and the viability of applying this model in non-health sectors. Evaluation questions explore the model in design and practice; what behavioral changes are observed; the degree to which governments and actors adopted the model; the feasibility of other sectors adopting the model; and, how the model can contribute to achieving USAID Development Objectives. The evaluation uses a qualitative analysis that applies transfer and sustainability criteria to key informant interview data. Interviewees include representatives from communities, governments, health facilities, decentralized sectors, NGOs, and firms. The results indicate the MCS model is versatile and can be applied in full or in part, according to context. Empowered community management councils work with local government and health officials to achieve health and other objectives. Five actors led the model in different contexts: multiple levels of government, a national institution, local governments, NGOs and private firms. The model is apt for adoption by different sectors and by USAID. The education, agricultural and housing sectors are particularly well suited to adopt the model. USAID already employs the model to strengthen community governance under alternative development activities, and the model can similarly serve as a vehicle for public service management and community forest management under DO2 and DO3. Future results and sustainability can be strengthened through the increased participation of regional governments, strengthening government and community council capacities, and replicating the projects success in identifying priority community demands as model entry points.",Evaluated project title: Healthy communities and municipalities II,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-527-C-13-00002,,2/1/2016 0:00,,Civic education ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Local level ~|~_©_~|~ Mortgages ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Sanitation education ~|~_©_~|~ Strategic objectives ~|~_©_~|~ Water sanitation,Peru,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TNS2.pdf,2723 KB,"041973 - Microsol Peru SAC ~|~_©_~|~ 040772 - Partners for Global Research and Development, LLC (PGRD)",,008591 - USAID.

PA-00T-NQ8,"This Final Evaluation constitutes an independent performance review of USAID/OTI Burmas Kann Let 2 (KL2) program from March 24, 2016, to March 23, 2019. The findings highlight the strategic approach, relevance, and impact of KL2 efforts to deepen and sustain the ongoing reform process in Burma and provide a concise explanation of achievements and lessons learned. The report is intended to inform future United States Government (USG) assistance, primarily the two new USAID/Burma Mission programs. Using a highly effective management strategy that involved empowerment of program development officers and grant managers, Development Alternatives Incorporated (DAI) implemented 233 Kann Let 2 activities, having spent $15.9 million, as of September 2018. From its desk review and extensive field work (including 98 interviews), the Final Evaluation Team found that the KL2 program identified the critical impediments standing in the way of reform in Burma, supported the work of groups aiming to build intercommunal harmony, expanded inclusion in the formal and informal peace processes, helped to foster and defend the space of civil society, and contributed substantially to US foreign policy. The evaluation recommends that future USAID assistance in Burma continue to support as much flexible, well-informed, locally-contextualized programming as possible, while retaining and utilizing KL2s significant analytical skills to address the barriers to advancing reform and peace.",Evaluated project title: Kann let 2,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-TO-15-00012 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-13-00006,,3/1/2019 0:00,,Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Judicial reform ~|~_©_~|~ Military ~|~_©_~|~ Missions (religious) ~|~_©_~|~ Political participation ~|~_©_~|~ Violence ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Burma,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TNQ8.pdf,1569 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,"010972 - USAID.

PA-00T-N2N,"World Hope International provides low-cost greenhouses to farmers in Sierra Leone and Mozambique  an agricultural innovation that has received monetary awards and support from Securing Water for Food. This report encompasses the monitoring and evaluation of the greenhouses installed in Mozambiques Gaza and Maputo provinces. In June 2018, field visits and interviews were conducted with 47 users to assess the innovation and its associated benefits. Since 2015, 44 greenhouses have been built and 33 still were operational by the time of this study. Farmers benefit from directly growing crops at the greenhouses, buying seedlings from the greenhouses owners, and learning new farming technique. With the greenhouses, farmers can grow crops faster and all year round, using less water and fewer seeds. Crops and seedlings grown in the greenhouses are of better quality and have greater chances for survival, because the greenhouses protect the plants from weather variations and pests. Farmers had an overall positive attitude towards the greenhouses and 87 percent of those interviewed plan to continue using them.",Evaluated project title:  Securing water for food (SWFF),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-C-15-00011,,11/1/2018 0:00,,Crops ~|~_©_~|~ Food ~|~_©_~|~ Greenhouses ~|~_©_~|~ Income ~|~_©_~|~ Seedlings ~|~_©_~|~ Seeds ~|~_©_~|~ Tomatoes ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Sierra Leone ~|~_©_~|~ Mozambique,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TN2N.pdf,4306 KB,"012951 - Kaizen Co., LLC",,040693 - U.S. Global Development Lab (GDL),English,application/pdf,,,"Capuano, Luciana",Crop production,Nov-18,,,,Securing water for food : World Hope impact evaluation : low-cost greenhouse farming in Mozambique,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=NTE5MDU0,,,,2018-11-01,2018,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
PA-00T-N2M,"The Bhungroo water harvesting system is an agricultural innovation that has received a monetary award and support from Securing Water for Food. The Bhungroo system helps smallholder farmers harvest rainwater throughout the monsoon season so they can use it during the dry season. The Bhungroo system was developed by Naireeta Services in the state of Gujarat, India, to tackle the issues of salinization, desertification, and water scarcity in the region. This report details monitoring and evaluation of the recent installation of 52 Bhungroo systems among the poorest smallholder farmers of Harij in Gujarats Patan district. From 62 interviews with Bhungroo owners in a stratified all-female sample, evaluators established a baseline using statistics on household incomes, crop yields, water practices, expenses, and perceptions and expectations of the Bhungroo system. Though findings are preliminary, the women studied in this report appear to have fewer resources and to be more heavily impacted by regional water stress than a small nearby sample of women with established Bhungroos. Aside from yield and income changes experienced as a result of using the Bhungroo system, the report suggests other important themes for further monitoring, including issues related to water sharing, irrigation practices and tools, and the climate and precipitation of the region. Water stress in the area appeared to be at an all-time high at the time of this study, while land degradation was unmistakably prominent. The systems owners expressed hope for the Bhungroo system, which presents a viable possibility for positive impact directly on their households and more broadly on soil restoration, food security, and female empowerment for the entire region.",Evaluated project title: Securing water for food (SWFF),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-C-15-00011,,9/1/2018 0:00,,Crop yield ~|~_©_~|~ Crops ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Grasses ~|~_©_~|~ Income ~|~_©_~|~ Maps ~|~_©_~|~ Wheat ~|~_©_~|~ Women,India,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TN2M.pdf,2466 KB,"012951 - Kaizen Co., LLC",,040693 - U.S. Global Development Lab (GDL),English,application/pdf,,,"Orentlicher, Natalie",Irrigated farming and water management,Sep-18,,,,Securing water for food : Naireeta Services evaluation : bhungroo water harvesting system in India,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=NTE5MDUz,India,,,2018-09-01,2018,IND,IND_2018,0.5789687754530711,0.773860226889698,0.605015673981191,0.22077587477166696,0.329381263119288,,0.6308211132583079,0.426546930410326,0.5855386146520319,0.24920254484979198,0.448354143019296,0.586716398326081,,0.447098581388035,0.55293813098628,,0.5912408759124089,IND,2018,1.0,0.49649903307813403,2.0,0.5059331185685837,AZE_2015,AZE_2014,VNM_2013,HND_2018,AZE_2013
PA-00T-N2K,"FutureWaters ThirdEye was a SWFF-supported infrared flying sensors project that created a group of flying sensors operators equipped with tools to analyze near infrared imagery in order to help farmers to make better decisions concerning the use of their limited resources, such as water, seeds and fertilizers. This report analyses the results obtained by the monitoring and evaluation field intern who conducted an evaluation survey in July and August 2018 in Mozambique, after the project had been active there for 3 years. A sample of 62 predominantly female smallholder farmers were interviewed out of an estimated total of 2,891 farmers located in the areas where the project was carried out: surroundings of the towns of Xai-Xai and Chokwé, in Gaza province. Farmers were randomly selected through visits to their farms and data was obtained on household income, crop yields, water practices and expenses. Even though it was not possible to quantify changes in water usage, the innovation is seen as having a positive indirect impact over water efficiency in some areas by serving as encouragement for farmers to clean water channels or by providing the necessary justification to have fields leveled.

PA-00T-KM1,"This report presents findings, conclusions, and lessons learned from an impact evaluation of the Womens Leadership in Small and Medium Enterprises (WLSME) activity in India. The evaluation used a quasi-experimental design, comparing four randomly assigned treatment groups to a matched comparison group across four outcome measures: business growth, entrepreneurial leadership, networks, and business knowledge and practices. The activity targeted 210 cashew-processing microenterprises and SMEs owned and managed by women in the Panruti block of Tamil Nadu State. After a baseline survey was conducted on eligible applicants, the sample was randomly assigned to four treatment groups. To avoid contamination, the comparison group was not randomized from the same sample as the treatment arms. Instead, it was randomly selected from a list of similar SMEs located in a geographically removed part of the Panruti block. The endline survey took place in May and June 2017, six months after the WLSME activity ended. The short-term findings are encouraging, primarily the entrepreneur leadership outcomes. Whereas most outcomes related to business growth, networks, and business knowledge and practices do not show a statistically significant link to the WLSME activity, the data show significant effects of sizable magnitude with respect to entrepreneur leadership.","On title page: October 26, 2017 (Revised March 6, 2019) ~|~_©_~|~ Footer title: Impact evaluation report : WLSME activity in India ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order title: Womens leadership in small and medium enterprises (WLSME) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: E3 analytics and evaluation",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-M-13-00017 ~|~_©_~|~ GS-23F-8012H,,3/1/2019 0:00,,Business growth ~|~_©_~|~ Cashews ~|~_©_~|~ Constraints ~|~_©_~|~ Entrepreneurs ~|~_©_~|~ Size ~|~_©_~|~ Small ~|~_©_~|~ Surveys ~|~_©_~|~ Women,India,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TKM1.pdf,800 KB,"003970 - Management Systems International, Inc.

This evaluation answers three evaluation questions (EQs), regarding VSFPs influence on parents school enrollment decision (EQ1), the probable impacts of pilot discontinuity on enrollment (EQ2), and canteen sustainability after VSFP ends (EQ3). The evaluation team (ET) conducted a desk review, 17 key informant interviews, and 25 focus group discussions. Alongside school data on student enrollment, attendance, and performance, the ET used these multiple data sources to analyze and draw findings, conclusions, and recommendations about VSFP.<br /><br /></span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">For EQ1, the evaluation concluded that school canteens are closely connected to parents decision to enroll their children. Other motivating factors include low tuition and education quality. However, for the most vulnerable, canteens factor significantly into families economic and livelihood decisions. For EQ2, the ET concluded that the canteen has a clear impact on attendance. Whether or not a child eats at school factors strongly into parents decisions about how frequently children go to school, and motivates students to arrive before school, and stay throughout the day. Overall, the ET found that school attendance frequency would decline if VSFP ends. For EQ3, stakeholders considered ways to continue the school feeding activities after VSFP. FPDI is actively seeking support for VSFPs continuation, however, area families face difficult economic situations, limiting most community stakeholders ability to materially contribute to ensure program continuity.</span></div>",Evaluated project title: Voucher school feeding pilot (VSFP,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-521-C-17-00002,,8/1/2018 0:00,,Child malnutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Children ~|~_©_~|~ Communes ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Enrollment ~|~_©_~|~ Poverty ~|~_©_~|~ School attendance ~|~_©_~|~ School feeding programs,Haiti,AID-521-A-15-00013,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TJR1.pdf,812 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008554 - USAID.

PA-00T-JCX,"<div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">The Nongovernmental Organization Health Service Delivery Project (NHSDP) was a flagship health project in Bangladesh funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). The project delivered an essential service package of reproductive, maternal, and child health services through a network of local nongovernmental organization (NGO) clinics that targeted the poor and underserved in rural and urban areas. The project was implemented from January 2013 to December 2017.<br /><br /></span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">MEASURE Evaluation, which is funded by USAID, conducted an impact evaluation of the project with the primary question of whether the NHSDP had increased the use of selected services at least by an amount comparable with increases in neighboring comparison areas. Baseline and end line data were collected on key outcomes of interest in project and adjacent non-project comparison areas. A difference-in-differences (DID) approach was used to estimate impact.<br /><br /></span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">The evaluation found that changes in key indicators in the NHSDP areas mirrored national trends and were similar to non-project areas. There was little change in modern contraceptive use across project and non-project areas, but the use of maternal health services increased in both areas, especially in rural areas. The DID analysis found no significant differences in the trends in outcomes in project and non-project areas. Changes in service use were similar across wealth quintiles. There was a decline in the NHSDPs market share across all services, especially in rural areas, accompanied by a shift to the private sector for healthcare among all groups and wealth quintiles.<br /><br /></span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">Moving forward, it will be critical to understand and adapt the role of the NGO sector in an environment in which people are increasingly obtaining their healthcare from the private sector.</span></div>","Footer title: ""NHSDP Impact Evaluation Report"" ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order title: NGO health service delivery project (NHSDP) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title:  Monitoring and evaluation to assess and use results (MEASURE)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-L-14-00004,,2/1/2019 0:00,,Birth ~|~_©_~|~ Health facilities ~|~_©_~|~ Land use ~|~_©_~|~ Reproduction ~|~_©_~|~ Rural areas ~|~_©_~|~ Surveys ~|~_©_~|~ Wealth ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Bangladesh,AID-388-C-13-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TJCX.pdf,5422 KB,000821 - University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

The main challenge is that most expertise required for SCS lies with ANSD's non-permanent staff, but plans are underway to solve this problem by years end.<br /><br /></span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">The GoS has so far contributed little to the SCS costs.

Should the GoS decide to move away from the continuous survey model, another option suggested by various stakeholders was to conduct both the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and the Service Provision Assessment (SPA) at intervals of two to three years with representative samples at the regional level.

PA-00T-J6B,"This ex-post evaluation examines the sustainability of outcomes from USAIDs Sustainable, Comprehensive Responses for Vulnerable Children and their Families (SCORE) activity. SCORE developed family-specific plans to graduate households from activity support. The activity focused on capacity building, improving socioeconomic status, food security, and access to protection and legal services. The evaluation collected qualitative data from beneficiaries and key stakeholders across seven districts in Uganda.<br /><br /> The evaluation found that households learned new skills and knowledge to help them mitigate their challenges, including village savings and loan associations, home gardening, and farming. However, financial instability remains a common challenge among households, and their circumstances and levels of vulnerability vary widely. About 88 percent of households reported experiencing a shock or stressor in the last year, although nearly 40 percent felt they did not have the ability to handle shocks, and 26 percent felt they could handle shocks but with difficulty. Respondents felt that SCORE did not provide enough support for the most critically vulnerable households (e.g., elderly, disabled). <br /><br />The evaluation concluded that SCOREs strengthening of households skills reduced the impact of shocks and stressors for many households. However, there is a need to examine hindering factors, particularly those beyond the activitys control such as natural disasters that can have a huge economic impact on households that rely on farming. As one of the first graduation models of its kind, lessons learned from SCORE  both positive and negative  require further testing and time, and strong monitoring and evaluation practices to continue to learn from them.","Evaluated task order title: Sustainable, comprehensive responses for vulnerable children and their families (SCORE) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title:  E3 analytics and evaluation",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-M-13-00017 ~|~_©_~|~ GS-23F-8012H,,12/1/2018 0:00,,Children ~|~_©_~|~ Food production ~|~_©_~|~ Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Households ~|~_©_~|~ Knowledge ~|~_©_~|~ Learning readiness ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion ~|~_©_~|~ Socioeconomic status,Uganda,AID-617-A-11-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TJ6B.pdf,1365 KB,"011492 - Development & Training Services, Inc.

PA-00T-J44,"<span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">This evaluation was performed for the U.S. Agency for International Development Bosnia and Herzegovina (USAID/BiH) to examine USAID/BiH Anti-Corruption Civic Organizations Unified Network (ACCOUNT) follow-on activity. The main objective of ACCOUNT is to create an environment that increases civil society participation to promote reform through collaboration and cooperation in anti-corruption initiatives. This Activity involves evidence-based research, civic monitoring, and investigative reporting on corruption cases in five sectors: i) public procurement, ii) whistleblower protection, iii) education, iv) health, and v) public employment. The evaluation focuses on the direct beneficiaries of the program and answers five research questions. The first question examines to what extent ACCOUNT has increased Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) involvement and input in determining anti-corruption legislation/regulation. The second question examines ACCOUNTs major achievements in public procurement, whistleblower protection, education, health, public employment, and local-level anti-corruption strategies/action plans. The third question examines to what extent ACCOUNT has increased the quality and quantity of investigative journalism targeting public corruption in BiH. The fourth question examines to what extent interventions under ACCOUNT have influenced public awareness of corruption. Finally, the fifth question examines if ACCOUNTs legal-aid model is perceived as effective by program beneficiaries. The evaluation team employed a mixed-methods approach to answer each of the evaluation questions through triangulation. In addition to the review of ACCOUNTs design and implementation documentation, we held 39 semi-structured interviews and a media panel discussion, with a total of 65 individuals participating in the evaluation. We also conducted surveys of media and CSO representatives and education workers, as well as reviewing the quality of investigative reports produced by ACCOUNT media outlets. Our evaluation shows that overall ACCOUNT performance is perceived as a positive CSO endeavor in the field of anti-corruption in Bosnia and Herzegovina. ACCOUNT gathered a significant number of CSOs in the Network on anti-corruption issues. Through advocacy activities, ACCOUNT facilitated the putting forward of quality CSO inputs and their partial integration into legislation in the field of anti-corruption. Achievements are evident in all five sectors, especially in relation to whistleblower-protection legislation and draft public-procurement legislation. The demand-driven approach was effective and contributed to the visible results. Since Annual Reports did not document progress against goals and objectives but rather according to activities, some achievements were difficult to identify and measure. Media reporting on corruption has been intensive among ACCOUNT media outlets, and an increased level of readership is noted. However, the team was not able to confirm a change in the quantity of media reporting due to the lack of any baseline data on corruption investigative reports, either in the aggregate or per individual media outlet. The quality of ACCOUNT investigative reporting within the content evaluation is generally rated above good, with one in four articles being very good or excellent. It is important to note that media reporting focuses primarily on quantity with regard to advocacy and awareness raising. However, the majority of citizens (80%) remain tied to traditional media outlets over online portals/social media, and the outreach of ACCOUNT investigative reporting remained limited. Citizens perceptions on corruption remain unchanged since 2015, which indicates that the ACCOUNT assumption that citizens would consume their online media products remains largely unfulfilled, as only 20 percent of citizens use the online sources as a means of consuming civic and political news. Regarding ACCOUNTs work on the establishment of an effective free legal-aid model to protect individuals reporting corruption and whistleblowers, the model has been useful but insufficient to protect citizens in the absence of a strong institutional and judicial system. In the end, we identified recommendations for future programming to support civil society engagement in anti-corruption, involvement of the media, and provision of free legal aid.</span>",Footer title: Performance evaluation of account follow-on activity ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Anti-corruption civic organizations' unified network (ACCOUNT) ~|~_©_~|~ COR: Elma Bukvic Jusic,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-168-C-14-00003,,2/1/2019 0:00,,Anticorruption interventions ~|~_©_~|~ Civil society ~|~_©_~|~ Internet ~|~_©_~|~ Journalism ~|~_©_~|~ Legal aid ~|~_©_~|~ Litigation ~|~_©_~|~ Networks ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration,Bosnia and Herzegovina,AID-168-A-15-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TJ44.pdf,3176 KB,"041024 - IMPAQ International, LLC",,009954 - USAID.

SEBIs activities are implemented under four specific, yet inter-related technical objectives. SEBI achieves those objectives through four main initiatives focusing on strengthening the capacity of a select number of social enterprises/entrepreneurs to help them become viable businesses, creating an enabling environment for the SE sector by improving institutional capacity through information sharing, raising public awareness of the sector, and reviewing options for a permanent version of the program potentially through Social Enterprise Jamaica (SEJA2). This final performance evaluation was commissioned to determine whether the SEBI activity achieved its objectives. The evaluation team was tasked with answering three questions regarding whether program objectives were achieved, adopting a mixed-methods approach based on interviews with direct beneficiaries and key stakeholders and focus group discussions with indirect beneficiaries, both in Kingston and St. Andrew, as well as the rural parishes. Two surveys were also conductedone with SEBI incubator and accelerator clients and a nationwide public awareness survey on SEs. The evaluation found that SEBI was instrumental in increasing public awareness of SEs although this varied according to geographic location. SEBIs clients also benefited from capacity building measures and creation of a SE network.</span>",Evaluated project title: Social enterprise boost initiative (SEBI),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-I-15-00024 ~|~_©_~|~ 72053218F00002,,12/1/2018 0:00,,Business enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Earnings ~|~_©_~|~ Entrepreneurship ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Music ~|~_©_~|~ Television ~|~_©_~|~ Women,Jamaica,AID-532-A-12-00004,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TH2K.pdf,2278 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates,,008563 - USAID.

PA-00T-GD5,"The USAID Assistance in Building Afghanistan by Developing Enterprises (ABADE), a five-year, $105 million activity that ended on July 31, 2018, was designed to support enterprise development and job creation through assistance to Small and Medium Enterprises. This final performance evaluation provides verification of activity outputs and outcomes, and assesses whether ABADE was implemented effectively. The report will serve as a lessons-learned document to inform the design and implementation of future activities. The statement of work focused on four questions: 1. To what extent program support to Small and Medium Enterprises contributed to increased employment, production, and access to finance, and enhanced ability of Small and Medium Enterprises to meet market requirements? 2. To what extent program reported on indicators, and effect of such monitoring on decisionmaking and implementation? 3. To what extent program was effective in leveraging investment from the private sector? 4. How worthwhile was programs investment in machinery; how sustainable is it likely to be? Methodology included document review; key informant interviews; focus group discussions; and a quantitative survey across four provincial centers. Conclusions:  Intervention logic was sound, but design had shortcomings: technical support requirements were under-estimated, intermediate outcomes were not tracked.  Outreach was effective, but implementation was hampered by delays in approvals, vetting, and customs.  Beneficiary Small and Medium Enterprises created jobs, accessed domestic and export markets, and increased sales and investment.  Procurement of machinery on behalf of Small and Medium Enterprises was a temporary fix and not a solution to the problem of access to finance.",Evaluated task order title: Assistance in building Afghanistan by developing enterprises (ABADE) ~|~_©_~|~ Task order title: Services under program and project office for results tracking-phase II (SUPPORT-II),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-306-C-12-00012,,12/1/2018 0:00,,Agricultural production ~|~_©_~|~ Business enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Economic growth ~|~_©_~|~ Exports ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Food production ~|~_©_~|~ Investment ~|~_©_~|~ Private sector,Afghanistan,AID-EEM-A-00-04-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TGD5.pdf,2437 KB,"Checchi and Company Consulting, Inc.",,USAID Mission to Afghanistan,English,application/pdf,,,"Abid, Rahmatullah ~|~_©_~|~ Dunn, Denis ~|~_©_~|~ Iqbal, Humayoon ~|~_©_~|~ Mufti, Babar",Economic growth and development,Dec-18,,,,Evaluation : final performance evaluation of assistance in building Afghanistan by developing enterprises,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=NTE1NDAw,Afghanistan,,,2018-12-01,2018,AFG,AFG_2018,0.17249453738066597,0.5588158246062579,0.7586206896551719,,0.24387603621955103,,,0.208608047860783,0.21721929113144603,,0.256526674233825,0.218522268155457,,0.0,0.37432047631374604,,0.474452554744526,AFG,2018,2.0,0.299263302165644,4.0,0.3311899815788683,ETH_2014,ETH_2013,ETH_2018,ETH_2015,AGO_2018

PA-00T-FNH,"<span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">Development Object (DO) 1 of the USAID/Kyrgyz Republic 2015-2019 Country Development Cooperation Strategy aims to support inclusive and accountable democracy. Eight activities under this DO sought to improve inclusivity and accountability in parliament, political parties, election agencies, human rights institutions, the judiciary, civil society, and media. This support sought to achieve a level of capacity in key democratic institutions that enables them to sustainability fulfill their respective missions and deliver public goods. This midterm performance evaluation of DO 1, through a review of documents, polling data, interviews, and focus groups, found the accountability of parliament, political parties, elections agencies, civil society, and the media improved between 2015 and 2017. There was only marginal improvement in the judiciary and human rights. USAID programming helped make democracy deliver in elections, civil society, and the media. Citizens were generally satisfied with democratic development and democratic institutions, and they did not seek systemic change except for a greater effort to fight corruption. The number of women holding national or local elective office has declined since the start of the evaluation period, but the 2020 elections will provide a fairer test of the effect of activities that have strengthened both womens leadership and youth participation. Citizens, including ethnic minorities, have increased access to civic information on government and political issues thanks to USAID activities. Together USAID-supported activities contributed to achieving Intermediate Result 1.1, Increased participation of all citizens in democratic processes, to a greater extent than the other two Intermediate Results.</span>","Evaluated task order title: Country development cooperation strategy (CDCS) development objective 1 evaluation, inclusive and accountable democracy ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Country development cooperation strategy (CDCS) development objective 1",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-486-I-14-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ 72011518F00001,,10/1/2018 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Democracy ~|~_©_~|~ Elections ~|~_©_~|~ Gender equity ~|~_©_~|~ Parliamentary systems ~|~_©_~|~ Political participation ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion ~|~_©_~|~ Youth,Kyrgyzstan,AID-486-I-14-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ 72011518F00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TFNH.pdf,1395 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008870 - USAID.

PA-00T-DV1,"The purpose of the evaluation of Strengthening Human Resources for Health (SHRH) Activity was to assess Activity progress and inform design for future Activities. The evaluation used mixed methods to answer five evaluation questions: (1) In what ways did the SHRH Activity contribute to improving human resources for health (HRH) and strengthening the regulatory environment in Ethiopia? (2) Did the Activity interventions facilitate local ownership, coordination and partnerships, and sustainability? (3) Were gender issues addressed in pre-service and in-service training? (4) Have Activity result/sub-result areas and interventions continued to be relevant to HRH gaps and challenges in Ethiopia? (5) Were there any facilitating and hindering factors? The SHRH Activity contributed to improved human resource management and quality of training in Oromia. Currently, Debre-Tabor University is ahead of its peers in the quality of its training. The SHRH Activity supported the federal regulatory agencies. However, the private sector continued to be more highly regulated than the public sector. Many of the Activitys interventions were sustainable, but research and program learning interventions had limited local ownership and will not be sustained. The Activity made contributions to address gender issues in pre-service education, but not with in-service training. Human resource management, quality improvement, and research were found to be the most relevant interventions for HRH. The SHRH Activity support was a key driver of change for HRH in Ethiopia, and where there were high levels of ownership, commitment, and leadership among the different levels of management at the Ministry, Regional, University, and Health Science Colleges, there was better performance.",Evaluated project title: Strengthening human resources for health (SHRH),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-663-C-16-00010,,11/1/2018 0:00,,Data collection ~|~_©_~|~ Health workers ~|~_©_~|~ Institutional sustainability ~|~_©_~|~ Learning readiness ~|~_©_~|~ Life skills ~|~_©_~|~ Ownership ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Students,Ethiopia,AID-663-A-12-00008,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TDV1.pdf,1934 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008543 - USAID.

This evaluation explores how CHC's design and implementation played a role in behavioral outcomes, how CHC coordination structures worked and contributed to increased capacity in SBCC, and how CHC has been able to generate and share evidence of effective SBCC practices with stakeholders.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class=""p2"">The evaluation followed a mixed method, non-experimental evaluation design, relying predominantly on qualitative data supported by quantitative evidence from both the national Lot Quality Assurance Sampling survey (LQAS) and CHCs own Phase I/baseline and Phase II/endline surveys to understand what worked with respect to CHC, how and where it worked, and why.<span class=""Apple-converted-space"">&nbsp;</span></p> <p class=""p2"">Findings showed CHC used 360-degree communication to saturate the national and local media and leverage community- and facility-based communication channels. This resulted in very high levels of message recall. <em>Obulamu </em>(a national media campaign) can be found everywhere. In terms of coordination, two of CHCs biggest achievements were: 1) helping to revitalize the SBCC technical working group (TWG) at the Ministry of Health (MoH) making it communication-focused as opposed to content-focused; and 2) streamlining the process by which SBCC materials get approved by the MoHs Health Promotion and Education (HPE) Department. These achievements were highly valued by the MoH and partners.

PA-00T-CQ1,"<div>This study estimated the impacts of Amazonía Lee, an early grade reading program in Peru delivering in-service teacher training, coaching, and materials as well as leadership training and non-monetary incentives to improve reading instruction. We examined impacts on teaching practices and literacy skills of participating students. We randomly assigned schools to a program group that implemented Amazonía Lee or a control group that did not. The study was conducted in two areas (departments) of the Amazon region. In one department, Ucayali, control schools received the usual services provided by the Ministry of Education. In the other department, San Martín, most control schools received a program known as Soporte Pedagógico, a Ministry initiative that offered teacher training and coaching, pedagogical materials, and remedial tutoring.<br /><br /></div> <div>In both regions, we found a few impacts on teacher instructional practices, including teachers increased explanation of different types of texts and greater vocabulary development. The impacts on students differed by region. In Ucayali, Amazonía Lee had positive and substantial impacts on reading outcomes. For example, students in Amazonia Lee on average could read one additional familiar word (7 versus 6, an impact equivalent to 0.24 standard deviations), 3.5 additional invented words (16.8 versus 13.4, an impact on decoding of 0.24 standard deviations), and scored higher on a reading comprehension test (impact of 0.27 standard deviations), with no gender differences. In San Martín, where Soporte Pedagógico was prevalent, we found no impacts on students reading outcomes relative to the control schools.</div>",Evaluated project title:  Amazonia lee (Amazon reads),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-M-12-00020,,1/1/2018 0:00,,Children ~|~_©_~|~ Classrooms ~|~_©_~|~ Demonstration ~|~_©_~|~ Learning readiness ~|~_©_~|~ Literacy ~|~_©_~|~ Materials ~|~_©_~|~ Mathematics ~|~_©_~|~ Students,Peru,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TCQ1.pdf,4435 KB,"000764 - Mathematica Policy Research, Inc.",,009839 - USAID.

PA-00T-CN9,"<div>The Advancing Partners &amp; Communities (APC) Project is a five-year USAID cooperative agreement with the John Snow, Inc. Research &amp; Training Institute, in collaboration with FHI 360, funded from October 2012, with a two-year extension until September 2019. This evaluation assessed the extent to which APC has achieved its objectives and identified community-based family planning (CBFP) activities that might warrant future investment. The evaluation questions examined APCs global leadership and advocacy for CBFP, its sub-grant program, and its efforts to strengthen the capacity of private voluntary organizations/nongovernmental organizations to implement effective programs. USAID will use the evaluation to inform future programming.</div> <div>The evaluation team visited APC projects in Benin and Uganda, conducting 114 key informant interviews, online surveys of Missions and grantees, and group discussions with health workers and clients. Key APC achievements included global- and country-level support for family planning (FP) and CBFP in 16 FP projects and implementation of HIV/AIDs, post-Ebola, and other health initiatives in 38 countries. CBFP advocacy focused on the global and country levels, where it promoted innovative CBFP programs, networking with local partners to advocate for changing policy/regulations in several African countries to allow community health workers to inject depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), to improve drug shops provision of injectable contraceptives, and ensure links to FP within broader community health policy agendas.</div> <div>Testing the efficacy of self-injection of subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC) was a major achievement; however, global advocacy for CBFP was not as focused. Key recommendations include improving monitoring and evaluation of sub-grants and related activities and continuing to collaborate with USAID and global partners to ensure wide and effective CBFP advocacy.</div>",Evaluated task order title: Advancing partners & communities (APC) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health program cycle improvement (GH Pro),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,,10/1/2018 0:00,,HIV/AIDS ~|~_©_~|~ Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Family health care ~|~_©_~|~ Family planning behavior ~|~_©_~|~ Leadership training ~|~_©_~|~ Youth,Uganda ~|~_©_~|~ Africa south of Sahara ~|~_©_~|~ Benin,AID-OAA-A-12-00047,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TCN9.pdf,1834 KB,040668 - Dexis Consulting Group,,011262 - USAID.

PA-00T-C2S,"The purpose of the Feed the Future Innovation Lab for Collaborative Research on Aquaculture &amp; Fisheries (AquaFish IL) is to expand research and the pool of researchers pursuing topics relevant to the primary thematic areas of aquaculture and fisheries. The AquaFish IL evaluation provides evidence-based findings and recommendations that USAID can use to inform and improve future investments in aquaculture and fisheries research to better achieve intended outcomes. The evaluation used document review and key informant interviews to answer questions related to the Management Entitys (ME) effectiveness in project implementation; coordination and communication; generation of quality research and collaborations; response to requests for technical assistance; and generation and development of the research technologies with greatest potential for future development. The evaluation found that, across most areas, the program performed well. AquaFish IL produced quality research through 103 peer-reviewed publications by the time of this evaluation. Another 40 to 50 were in preparation. AquaFish IL supported over 275 long-term degree-seeking students (51 percent women) and provided short-term training for over 2,000 participants (45 percent women). It also produced innovative technologies, including developing Pangasius culture in hyposaline conditions in Bangladesh. However, the ME had limited success in forging strong relationships with USAID Missions. This was partly because the Mission staff had time constraints, which limited their engagement. Interviewees recommended that fish feeds and feeding, production systems and management, mobile phone-based technologies, and air-breathing and indigenous fishes merit future research as they are high priorities for host countries participating in AquaFish IL.",Evaluated task order title: Feed the Future Innovation Lab for collaborative research on aquaculture & fisheries (AquaFish IL) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Program evaluation for effectiveness and learning (PEEL),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-TO-16-00008 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-1-12-00024,,9/1/2018 0:00,,Agricultural technology ~|~_©_~|~ Aquaculture ~|~_©_~|~ Coastal fisheries ~|~_©_~|~ Demonstration ~|~_©_~|~ Fisheries ~|~_©_~|~ Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Institutional sustainability ~|~_©_~|~ Learning readiness,Nepal ~|~_©_~|~ Cambodia ~|~_©_~|~ Vietnam ~|~_©_~|~ Tanzania ~|~_©_~|~ Ghana ~|~_©_~|~ Bangladesh ~|~_©_~|~ Kenya ~|~_©_~|~ Uganda,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00TC2S.pdf,1525 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates,,013469 - USAID.

PA-00T-9T3,"We present the results of a study designed to benchmark a major USAID-funded child malnutrition program against what would have occurred if the cost of the program had simply been disbursed directly to beneficiaries to spend as they see fit. Using a three-armed trial from 248 villages in Rwanda, the study measures impacts on households containing poor or malnourished children, or pregnant or lactating women, as well as the broader population of study villages. We find that the bundled health program delivers benefits in an outcome directly targeted by specific sub-components of the intervention (savings), but does not improve dietary diversity, child anthropometrics, or anemia within the year of the study. A cost-equivalent cash transfer boosts productive asset investment and allows households to pay down debt. The bundled program is significantly better in cost-equivalent terms at generating savings and worse for debt reduction. A much larger cash transfer of more than $500 per household improves a wide range of consumption measures including dietary diversity, as well as higher savings, assets, and housing values. Only the large cash transfer shows evidence of moving child outcomes, with modest effects on anthropometrics (significant at or just below the 10% level). The results indicate that programs targeted towards driving specific outcomes can do so at lower cost than cash, but large cash transfers drive substantial benefits across a wide range of impacts, including many of those targeted by the more tailored program.",Evaluated task order title: Development impact lab ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Higher education solutions network  (HESN),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-A-13-00002,,6/1/2018 0:00,,Business enterprises ~|~_©_~|~ Child malnutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Health care costs ~|~_©_~|~ Households ~|~_©_~|~ Infant nutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Savings ~|~_©_~|~ Villages,Rwanda,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T9T3.pdf,4386 KB,"000320 - University of California, Berkeley",,040693 - U.S. Global Development Lab (GDL),English,application/pdf,,,"McIntosh, Craig ~|~_©_~|~ Zeitlin, Andrew",Child nutrition,Jun-18,,,,Impact evaluation report : benchmarking a child nutrition program against cash : experimental evidence from an evaluation in Rwanda,,https://dec.usaid.gov/dec/content/Detail.aspx?ctID=ODVhZjk4NWQtM2YyMi00YjRmLTkxNjktZTcxMjM2NDBmY2Uy&rID=NTExODE0,Rwanda,,,2018-06-01,2018,RWA,RWA_2018,0.631184145450926,0.652186330018765,0.36050156739811895,0.662475097656984,0.139154968093823,,,0.199080424870463,0.569403481118605,0.319294060840909,0.158910329171396,0.5251842471839749,,0.556493897178213,0.8102511001812058,,0.554744525547445,RWA,2018,1.0,0.5571249075319886,3.0,0.3994449613598424,BFA_2014,MOZ_2016,LBR_2016,MOZ_2014,MLI_2014

PA-00T-9NZ,"Executed by Tetra Tech Associates in Rural Development from January 2013 to October 2018, United States Agency for International Development/Haitis Limiyé ak Òganizasyon pou Kolektivite yo ale Lwen (LOKAL+) project sought to increase communal government legitimacy through improved governance and improved service delivery in nine target communes by increasing local government technical and management capacity. This evaluation assessed the projects: 1) relevance to Government of Haiti concerns and needs; 2) effectiveness in improving three domains: accountability, transparency (see Annex I for definitions), and service delivery; and 3) sustainability of improving governance in target communes. Methods included a document review, 29 key and group informant interviews (involving 50 officials), 35 focus group discussions (involving 162 female and 168 male citizens), and 12 direct observation site visits in target communes. Almost all stakeholders stated that LOKAL+ was very effective in improving accountability, transparency, and service delivery, especially for tax collection and sanitation. However, except for a sizeable minority in St. Marc, Carrefour, and Cap Haitian, respondents felt that communes have no capacity to independently continue improved governance in these three domains. Nonetheless, given Haitis historically highly centralized and opaque local governance, it is important to note three fundamentally important changes brought about by the project: 1) LOKAL+ has demonstrated that it is possible for communes to be financially sound and administratively autonomous; 2) it has introduced the notion of transparency to municipal citizens; and 3) it has successfully improved critical administrative systems such as tax collection administration, housing census, and database management.",Footer title: Final evaluation report ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Limiye ak oganizasyon pou kolektivite yo ale lwen (LOKAL+),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-521-C-17-00002,,7/1/2018 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Communes ~|~_©_~|~ Decentralization ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Local level ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Transparency ~|~_©_~|~ Violence against women,Haiti,AID-521-C-13-00004,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T9NZ.pdf,1258 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008554 - USAID.

The purpose of the evaluation was to capture information from the inception of the activities through May 2018 on the diverse areas in which the two activities were able to achieve real impact and promote meaningful change despite the challenging operating environment. The evaluation questions addressed the following: a) progress made toward the activity objectives; b) achievements that were not part of the work plans; and c) program design for effectively adapting to local challenges. The evaluation used a non-experimental design that employed both qualitative and quantitative methods, including 64 semi-structured key informant interviews; 4 focus group discussions; and a face-to-face survey of 1192 households. The key conclusions were: <br />? Relatively high public confidence in elections, in large part due to the capacity built by USAID of the High National Election Commission <br />? Willingness among national and municipal legislators receiving USAID assistance to factor citizen input into their work <br />? Although the concept of advocacy is still new, womens and marginalized groups supported by USAID successfully advocated issues <br />?

PA-00T-9HS,"<p class=""p1"">USAID/Georgia began a five-year project entitled Strengthening Elections and Political Processes (SEPPs) in 2014, two years after the first peaceful transfer of power in the country, at what looked like a promising time for the development of Georgias democratic political processes. This evaluation explores the performance of this effort based on the progress that had been accomplished towards its objectives and ultimate goal. The overarching goal of the project  Georgia's democratic electoral and political processes are deepened and institutionalized was pursued through three objectives: strengthening of political parties, improvement of government capacity to administer and oversee free and fair electoral processes, and enhancement of civic engagement and national consensus around electoral and political processes. These objectives were pursued via interventions implemented by three international (IFES, IRI, and NDI) and three local (ISFED, GYLA, and TI-Georgia) partners. The evaluation addressed five primary questions specified by USAID: Did the performance of the projects six activities meet expectations and achieve expected results? Were there gaps in achieving the three objectives? Did the activities meet the expectations of their direct beneficiaries? Were the projects goals feasible given the ability of USAID to influence? Did the project offer lessons learned from utilizing local partners? The evaluation team adopted a multi-faceted and mixed-method approach to its evaluation. This approach included extensive documentary research, interviews with the implementing partners, and three primary evidence-based research methods with stakeholders: semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions, and a mini-survey. The evaluation established that the projects objectives and subobjectives are generally on target to be met. However, there are structural issues in Georgias political system that continue to hinder political competition. In this context, it will be critical for USAID going forward to tackle the more fundamental objective of making political competition an acceptable and assumed part of the Georgian political system.</p>",Evaluated project title: Strengthening electoral and political processes project (SEPPS),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,72011418P00026,,8/1/2018 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Democracy ~|~_©_~|~ Elections ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Political participation ~|~_©_~|~ Political parties ~|~_©_~|~ Public opinion ~|~_©_~|~ Voting,Georgia,AID-114-LA-14-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-114-LA-14-00006 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-114-LA-14-00005 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-114-A-16-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-114-A-16-00003 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-114-F-16-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T9HS.pdf,10237 KB,009831 - Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening (CEPPS),,009620 - USAID.

The evaluation used a mixed-methods approach, including document review; analysis of HEAs monitoring and evaluation data and performance indicators; key informant interviews and surveys for faculty/staff; focus group discussions; and direct observation. Key illustrative findings include: 1) teachers consider diploma programs available, high quality, and wellfacilitated; 2) trust has been established via positive and significant effects from collaboration; 3) while there has been an established approach to construct a higher education policy, the approach needs to be broader in terms of participants (including the government); 4) there is improved access to science, technology, engineering, and math for women and girls; and 5) the Centers for Career Development, which promote student engagement with the private sector, are the most likely to sustain. The evaluation recommends that USAID continue to support the investigations, curriculum reform implementation, teacher training, and scholarships, as well initiate as the construction of an entity to strategically integrate and give continuity to the cluster model.",Evaluated project title: Higher education for economic growth,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-I-15-00024 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-519-TO-16-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-519-C-14-00004,,5/1/2018 0:00,,Economic development ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Gender equality ~|~_©_~|~ Higher education ~|~_©_~|~ Learning readiness ~|~_©_~|~ Life skills ~|~_©_~|~ Manufacturing ~|~_©_~|~ Mathematics,El Salvador,AID-519-C-14-00004,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T881.pdf,1283 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates,,008540 - USAID.

PA-00T-6QS,"<div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">USAIDs Center of Excellence for Democracy, Human Rights and Governance contracted Social Impact, Inc. to conduct an impact evaluation of USAIDs Ghana Strengthening Accountability Mechanisms (GSAM) program, which aims to increase accountability of local District Assemblies in Ghana. This impact evaluation, a randomized-controlled trial, tests the effect of two distinct efforts to increase accountability and improve service delivery outcomes at the district level. One hundred fifty of Ghanas districts were matched and randomized into one of three groups: a top-down treatment group that received performance audits conducted by the central government Ghana Audit Service (GAS); a bottom-up treatment group that received civil-society organization (CSO) led scorecard campaigns; and a control group that did not receive either intervention.</span></div> <div><span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">Through surveys with citizens, local administrators, and local politicians and through a review of administrative data, we find that both CSO and GAS programming have had some important impacts, even as some features of district governance are difficult to change. Across both GAS and CSO programming, GSAM reduces citizen satisfaction with projects and services, a finding largely driven by the districts that receive negative audit reports. This indicates that citizens are correctly attributing bad audit performance to poor-performing District Assemblies. CSO and GAS programming have different effects. GSAMs bottom-up, citizen-focused, CSO programming has generally had more effect on citizen engagement and the behavior of administrators than top-down GAS programming. At the same time, the top-down GAS programming has had a bigger effect on politicians, who are sensitive to incentives created by centralized party and budget systems, and who have decreased political manipulation of the budget as a result of the intervention. Despite these improvements, there are a number of areas of district project and budget management, including development project completion, that were unaffected by the interventions.</span></div>","Task order title: Democracy, human rights & governance - learning, evaluation, and research (DRG-LER) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Ghana strengthening accountability mechanisms (GSAM)",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-M-13-00011 ~|~_©_~|~ GS-10F-0294V ~|~_©_~|~ AID-641-A-15-00002,,4/1/2018 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Anticorruption interventions ~|~_©_~|~ Development projects ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Households ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Rule of law ~|~_©_~|~ Transparency,Ghana,AID-641-A-15-00002,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T6QS.pdf,1846 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc. ~|~_©_~|~ 010850 - CARE USA",,"040194 - USAID.

This process was part of a broader effort to devolve administrative, fiscal, and legal powers to local and provincial entities in Iraq and to provide local service delivery to a broader section of society through a decentralized governance model in accordance with the law. Through enhanced efficiency in delivering provincial government-based services, the project assumed that this would lead to increased government responsiveness to community needs and citizen participation in decision-making, which ultimately would garner the state heightened legitimacy and stability. This evaluation sought to delineate the failures and successes of the project with a keen awareness of the complexities in post-conflict Iraqi society and the various stakeholders and beneficiaries, namely women, the elderly, ethnic minorities and other vulnerable groups. Overall, the Taqadum effort has achieved success in supporting a partial devolution of power through training and support for development mapping and planning processes from ministries to directorates and for service delivery improvement planning and implementation at the provincial levels. Despite these successes, legal and fiscal decentralization are largely incomplete and citizen perception of both GOI and local service delivery remains low. The latter may be due to lack of inclusivity of citizen participation from a broad spectrum of society and public awareness of advances made in decentralization and service delivery.</span>","Evaluated project title: Governance strengthening project (GSP)/ taqadum ""moving forward"" ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Performance management and support program (PMSP) ~|~_©_~|~ English ed.: PA-00T-4BH",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-267-TO-17-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-15-00022,,3/1/2018 0:00,,,Middle East ~|~_©_~|~ Iraq,AID-267-C-11-00006,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T4BK.pdf,1583 KB,"001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

The latter may be due to lack of inclusivity of citizen participation from a broad spectrum of society and public awareness of advances made in decentralization and service delivery.</span>","Evaluated project title: Governance strengthening project (GSP)/ taqadum ""moving forward"" ~|~_©_~|~ Project title:  Performance management and support program (PMSP) ~|~_©_~|~ Arabic ed.: PA-00T-4BK",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-267-TO-17-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-15-00022,,3/1/2018 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Civic education ~|~_©_~|~ Decentralization ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Health care costs ~|~_©_~|~ Sports ~|~_©_~|~ The state ~|~_©_~|~ Youth,Middle East ~|~_©_~|~ Iraq,AID-267-C-11-00006,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00T4BH.pdf,4803 KB,"001891 - International Business and Technical Consultants, Inc.

ILSSI aims to contribute to Feed the Futures overarching goal of sustainably reducing global poverty and hunger through transforming key production systems and enhancing nutrition and food security through small scale irrigation (SSI). This external performance evaluation assessed ILSSIs achievements and provides empirical evidence supporting learning and improvement for BFS Feed the Future work. The evaluation team (ET) used mixed-methods and multiple sources of evidence, including document review, observations, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and field visits to Ethiopia and Ghana. The ET found that ILSSI is well managed, despite being a complex project with activities across three countries. The project provided capacity building on high-demand Integrated Decision Support System and associated models to universities, research institutes, and government entities. Farmers indicated that the new technologies and practices ILSSI introduced have potential to increase yields, incomes, and living standards. The research is high quality but several economic and social-behavioral issues, including access to equipment and supply chains, unwillingness to pay for equipment, and sparse ground support, constrain scaling up. Partners recognize these issues but note the importance of understanding and addressing them before scaling up SSI. To facilitate scaling-up, the evaluation recommends a second ILSSI phase that incorporates entrepreneurial and practical solutions for research, covers environmental and economic conditions, and focuses on market solutions and scaling innovations, while continuing to generate knowledge.</span>",Evaluated project title: Innovation lab for small scale irrigation (ILSSI) ~|~_©_~|~ Task order title: Feed the future program evaluation for effectiveness and learning (PEEL),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-TO-16-00008 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-15-00024,,3/1/2018 0:00,,Agricultural production ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural technology ~|~_©_~|~ Farmers ~|~_©_~|~ Female empowerment ~|~_©_~|~ Food production ~|~_©_~|~ Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Irrigation ~|~_©_~|~ Small farms ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural equipment ~|~_©_~|~ Equipment costs ~|~_©_~|~ Local capacity building ~|~_©_~|~ Crop quality,Africa south of Sahara ~|~_©_~|~ Ghana ~|~_©_~|~ Ethiopia,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00SW4K.pdf,1262 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates,,013469 - USAID.

PA-00S-WXH,"<span style=""font-size: 13.3333px;"">The Soybean Innovation Lab (SIL) is a 5-year, $10 million Research-for-Development (R4D) project, managed by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (2013-2018). SIL researches factors limiting adoption and sustainability of soybean production, processing, and consumption in sub-Saharan Africa. The research results are translated to key stakeholders, including development practitioners, the private sector, and government agencies. The evaluation of SIL focuses on program management; the research and training program; institutional collaboration; and the programs future. In visits to Urbana-Champaign, Ghana, and Ethiopia, the evaluation team collected qualitative and quantitative data through 1) program document review; 2) 59 key informant interviews; 3) group discussions with Principal Investigators; 4) direct observation of two key program-related events; 5) case studies of selected R4D products; and 6) an online survey of 35 SIL staff and partners. SILs R4D products are largely appropriate, but dissemination should be part of the research process and guided by articulation of development pathways for R4D products. The evaluation found that SILs wide range of partnerships has successfully developed institutional capacity, but more networking and linkage activitiesby both SIL and USAIDare recommended. SILs current investments in technical research areas should continue, with particular attention paid to practical ways research is undertaken to ensure technology uptake. Gaps in market linkages for input and output value chains need to be identified and addressed. In the future, extension support to development partners and feedback loops on the uptake and use of SILs R4D products and associated outputs will also be needed.</span>",Evaluated project title: Research-for-development (R4D) ~|~_©_~|~ Task order title: Feed the future program evaluation for effectiveness and learning (PEEL),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-TO- 16-00008 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-15-00024,,3/1/2018 0:00,,Agricultural innovations ~|~_©_~|~ Value chains ~|~_©_~|~ Soybeans ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural research ~|~_©_~|~ Crop production ~|~_©_~|~ Networks ~|~_©_~|~ Input output analysis ~|~_©_~|~ Gender integration ~|~_©_~|~ Human nutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Farms,Africa south of Sahara,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00SWXH.pdf,2617 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates,,013469 - USAID.

PA-00S-XH8,"The United States Agency for International Development (USAID)/Haiti Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS) activity supported the Government of Haiti (GOH) in developing a system for transparent management of public revenues and expenditures.&nbsp; This final performance evaluation focused on Phase V of the activity, implemented by Chemonics International from September 2014 to March 2018.&nbsp; To answer three evaluation questions (EQs) regarding activity effectiveness (EQ 1), utilization (EQ 2), and sustainability (EQ 3), the evaluation team conducted a document review, 20 key informant interviews, 8 group interviews, and site observations including 12 diagnostics.&nbsp; For EQ 1, the evaluation concluded that infrastructure and systems implementation remain ongoing.&nbsp; Because the infrastructure is incomplete, aspects of the systems are not being used by intended beneficiaries.&nbsp; The activity conducted several trainings, but participants have not had opportunities to apply acquired skills.&nbsp; Connectivity and electricity issues hindered IFMS, as did lack of buy-in from GOH leadership.&nbsp; For EQ 2, GOH is using IFMS hardware and infrastructure, but not using some of the software applications.&nbsp; Financial reporting within the GOH remains the same as before this phase, real-time data exchange is not occurring, and gains to improve fiscal transparency were minimal.&nbsp; For EQ 3, the IFMS intranet and Network Operating Center were the activity's most sustainable aspects, whereas non-infrastructure investments are currently less sustainable.&nbsp; More training and coaching on the new systems are required.&nbsp; The activity did not have a sustainability plan or exit strategy in place at the time of the evaluation.&nbsp; (Author abstract)",Footer title: IFMS evaluation report ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated task order title: Integrated financial management system (IFMS) ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Haiti evaluation and survey services,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-521-C-17-00002,,3/1/2018 0:00,,Accountability ~|~_©_~|~ Financial management ~|~_©_~|~ Governance ~|~_©_~|~ Networks ~|~_©_~|~ Public administration ~|~_©_~|~ Revenues ~|~_©_~|~ Security ~|~_©_~|~ Transparency,Haiti,AID-521-TO-14-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-12-00035,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00SXH8.pdf,1038 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008554 - USAID.

PA-00S-V5J,"The USAID-funded Tax Policy and Administration Reform (TPAR) and Fiscal Policy and Expenditure Management (FPEMP) programs sought to strengthen fiscal administration processes and supporting information technology (IT) systems in El Salvador in order to contribute to a modern fiscal policy management system and increased tax collections.&nbsp; The TPAR and FPEMP performance evaluation examined the extent to which they individually and jointly contributed to achieving these objectives and the likely sustainability of their achievements.&nbsp; The evaluation also examined questions related to how external factors contributed to program achievements and the program's coordination with other donor organizations.&nbsp; The evaluation concludes that TPAR and FPEMP made strong contributions to improving fiscal policy management processes and supporting IT systems within the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and its several Directorates, which in turn have both directly and indirectly contributed to increased tax collections in the country via increased voluntary compliance, increased collection of tax arrears, and reduced tax evasion.&nbsp; The administrative and IT reforms enacted with program support are, for the most part, in the process of being institutionalized within the MOF Directorates, implying good prospects for long-term sustainability once USAID's assistance has ended.&nbsp; TPAR and FPEMP also contributed to strengthening MOF's technical capacity, improving fiscal transparency, and engaging the private and public sectors for the purpose of fiscal policy legal reform.&nbsp; In doing so, the programs benefited in many cases from incremental to substantive contributions from other donor organizations and MOF's own initiative, and ongoing support from the Government of El Salvador (GOES) and MOF.&nbsp; (Author abstract, modified)",Evaluated task order title: Tax policy and administration reform (TPAR) ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Fiscal policy and expenditure management (FPEMP) ~|~_©_~|~ Spanish ed.:PA-00S-XFF,Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-519-TO-16-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-15-00024,,12/1/2017 0:00,,Fiscal policy ~|~_©_~|~ Taxation ~|~_©_~|~ Tax collection ~|~_©_~|~ Tax evasion ~|~_©_~|~ Transparency ~|~_©_~|~ Legal reform ~|~_©_~|~ Donor coordination ~|~_©_~|~ Sustainable development,El Salvador,GEG-I-05-04-00001-00 ~|~_©_~|~ GEG-I-00-04-00001-00 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GEG-I-05-04-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-GEG-I-00-04-00001 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-519-C-11-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00SV5J.pdf,1177 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates,,"008540 - USAID.

PA-00S-SDW,"USAID/Burma contracted Social Impact, Inc. to conduct a final rigorous performance evaluation of the Shae Thot program, an integrated model for community development in Burma.&nbsp; This evaluation examined the project's performance and effectiveness, focusing on program impact, the integrated approach, program sustainability, and advancement of equality and inclusion.&nbsp; This mixed-methods evaluation collected data through 4,680 household surveys, 233 village surveys, 23 focus group discussions, and 54 key informant interviews.&nbsp; Although direct attribution to Shae Thot interventions is not possible, substantial improvement was apparent in virtually all Shae Thot outcomes since program inception: access to healthcare and health outcomes, maternal and child health, water access and sanitation; and use of inputs and crop yields.&nbsp; Although rates of improvement were comparable in the comparison group, some indicators improved faster in Shae Thot areas.&nbsp; Gains in perception of economic growth were palpable, and widely credited to Shae Thot.&nbsp; Households' perception of food security and economic wellbeing improved drastically while food scarcity sharply decreased, compared to smaller gains in comparison areas.&nbsp; Sources of income diversified (i.e., double the number of households reported livestock/poultry breeding).&nbsp; Borrowing practices changed over time, exemplified by a four-fold drop in borrowing from money lenders, and increased demand for loans for agricultural goods and animals purchase and business investment.&nbsp; Shae Thot's integrated approach was reported to be a key driver of change in program outcomes, particularly village development committees and funds, community governance structures that acted as central coordinating bodies of community-driven development and financial sustainability.&nbsp; (Author abstract)","Evaluated project title: Shae Thot ""the way forward"" ~|~_©_~|~ Mid-term evaluation: PA-00K-T6G",Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-482-TO-00002 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-486-I-14-00001,,2/1/2018 0:00,,Maternal child health care ~|~_©_~|~ Child mortality ~|~_©_~|~ Care of the newborn ~|~_©_~|~ Households ~|~_©_~|~ Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Access to resources ~|~_©_~|~ Potable water ~|~_©_~|~ Water quality ~|~_©_~|~ Hygiene ~|~_©_~|~ Community development ~|~_©_~|~ Social change,Burma,AID-486-A-11-00010,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00SSDW.pdf,3477 KB,"011933 - Social Impact, Inc.",,008521 - USAID.

PA-00S-RX6,"The Peace Corps Participating Agency Program Agreement (PAPA) was started in 2011.&nbsp; It has involved nine funding sources including the Bureau of Food Security (BFS), the Africa Bureau, and seven Missions.&nbsp; The aim is to support the Feed the Future goals of reducing poverty and malnutrition.&nbsp; The evaluation of PAPA was conducted by a two-person team with fieldwork in Zambia and Senegal and used a case study design.&nbsp; It consisted of document review, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, observation, and digital photography.&nbsp; Three overarching questions were examined looking at outcomes, planning and coordination, and the Peace Corps approach.&nbsp; The evaluation found that there were differences between USAID and Peace Corps in how each organization perceived contribution to Feed the Future's goals, objectives, and intermediate results and what it valued.&nbsp; USAID focused on change in quantitative variables that would indicate the achievement of results while Peace Corps emphasized the capacity building processes that it expected would lead to those results.&nbsp; The evaluation identified the factors that have positively and negatively affected the achievement of Feed the Future objectives, and made actionable recommendations for both USAID and Peace Corps to inform future similar agreements and enhance their effectiveness in achieving Feed the Future objectives.&nbsp; (Author abstract)",Task order title: Feed the future program evaluation for effectiveness and learning (PEEL),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-TO-16-00008 ~|~_©_~|~ AID-OAA-I-15-00024,,12/1/2017 0:00,,Food security ~|~_©_~|~ Poverty reduction ~|~_©_~|~ Nutrition improvement ~|~_©_~|~ Malnutrition ~|~_©_~|~ Agricultural production,Senegal ~|~_©_~|~ Zambia,AID-BFS-T-11-00001,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00SRX6.pdf,1291 KB,008414 - Mendez England and Associates,,013469 - USAID.

PA-00S-RRZ,"USAID/Madagascar Mikolo Project supports Madagascar's national policy for the implementation of community-based service delivery, to increase access to and availability of community-based primary health care, especially for women of reproductive age, children under age five, and infants living in remote areas of Madagascar.&nbsp; This evaluation of the Mikolo Project is to: (1) to learn to what extent the project's goals and objectives have been achieved; and (2) to inform the design of a future community-based health services activity.&nbsp; The evaluation explored if Mikolo will achieve its objectives, how it improved the Government of Madagascar's use of data for decision-making, and how effective is Mikolo's management structure.&nbsp; This evaluation utilized qualitative methods (i.e., document review, key informant interviews, focus group discussions and observations), supplemented by a review of existing quantitative data (e.g., project data and Community Health Volunteer (CHV) monthly report data).&nbsp; Working closely with the Madagascar Ministry of Public Health (MOPH), Mikolo has been successful in achieving most of its targeted outcomes in support of community health service delivery.&nbsp; Areas for improvement include training, support, and supervision for CHVs; community engagement for demand creation and healthy practices; and referral systems.&nbsp; Working with local NGOs and MOPH, data quality has improved, but more work is needed to improve the use of these data.&nbsp; (Author abstract)",Evaluation assignment number 383 ~|~_©_~|~ Evaluated project title: Mikolo ~|~_©_~|~ Project title: Global health program cycle improvement (GH pro),Final Evaluation Report,Documents,AID-OAA-C-14-00067,,12/1/2017 0:00,,Communes ~|~_©_~|~ Communities ~|~_©_~|~ Disease prevention and control ~|~_©_~|~ Health care costs ~|~_©_~|~ Households ~|~_©_~|~ Sports ~|~_©_~|~ USAID ~|~_©_~|~ Youth,Madagascar,,http://pdf.usaid.gov/pdf_docs/PA00SRRZ.pdf,3093 KB,040668 - Dexis Consulting Group,,008572 - USAID.
