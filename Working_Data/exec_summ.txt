EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This  report  is  a  performance  evaluation  of  an  activity  funded  by  the  United  States  Agency  for International Development (USAID) mission in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Excellence in Innovation Activity (EIA), an economic development activity that commenced in December 2007 and ended in August 2013. The aim of the Activity was to enhance the competitiveness of SMEs within four industries in Bosnia and Herzegovina through the transfer and application of information and communication technologies previously inaccessible to SMEs in BiH. The prime awardee/implementer for the Activity was ‘fhi360’ while the primary implementing partner responsible for the day-to-day implementation was the Education Development Center (EDC). The Evaluation was conducted and completed while the EI Activity was still ongoing. Information and data collection commenced in June 2013 and the first interview was on 24 June 2013 with the EIA, its COP and other staff members. Information and data collection ended in August 2013, with the last interview held on 23 August 2013 with the EIA. The Evaluation Report was prepared on the basis of information and data received within the aforementioned period.  PURPOSE OF THE EVALUATION AND EVALUATION QUESTIONS The evaluation served a dual purpose: (1) to provide information for the design of a new USAID project1 within the Economic Growth Portfolio and (2) to learn to what extent the objectives and goals of the Activity were realized. The evaluation reviewed the accomplishments of all four USAID supported e-BIZ centers taking into consideration both the original Cooperative Agreement period and the subsequent extension.  The main evaluation questions sought answers in relation to the level of success achieved in terms of capacity building efforts aimed at e-BIZ center staff, improvements in the competitiveness of the served SMEs as well as the targeted industries in their entirety and an analysis of the financial and operational                                                 1According to the new USAID definition, “A project is defined as a set of executed interventions (activities) over an established timeline and budget intended to achieve a specific development purpose in order to solve a defined problem. In general, it is expected that a project purpose will correlate to intermediate results (IR) in the CDCS’ Results Framework”. 2 

sustainability of the e-BIZ centers.  The Evaluation Team has strong reservations about the information and data provided by EIA, the  e-BIZ  centers  and  interviewed  SMEs.  The  EIA  and  e-BIZ  centers  interfered  with  the evaluation process at several points by adjusting documents and providing documents that were produced after the evaluation process had begun. This interference made a realistic evaluation of project performance difficult and challenging. The Evaluation Team is aware of the Activity implementation issues that caused discontinuity in the project management flow and had negative impact even on some e-BIZ Centers, such as Exploring BiH. Here we primarily refer to: (i) AED suspension from receiving new U.S. Government awards pending an ongoing investigation by the USAID Office of Inspector General (OIG); (ii) Dismissal and replacement of COP at the late stage of the project; (iii) issues with involvement of Exploring Macedonia in the Activity and issues related to ownership of Exploring Macedonia and eFondacija over the Exploring BH and attempts of Exploring BH Director, Ms. SV, to resolve these issues by investing her own capital into the project and takeover Exploring BH.   PROJECT BACKGROUND The Excellence in Innovation Activity utilized information and communication technology (ICT) as part of the USAID effort to generate employment and promote the expansion and competitiveness of SMEs in BiH. The Activity aligned to the Foreign Assistance Framework Economic Growth Program in the area of Private Sector Competitiveness and the program element Private Sector Capacity. The EIA provided assistance to and collaborated with BiH entrepreneurs and firms to establish and operate sustainable e-BIZ centers/enterprises capable of offering high impact ICT applications and services to SMEs in the targeted and supported sectors. Collaboration with the e-BIZ centers/enterprises was intended to enhance the capacities of SMEs to utilize the ICT applications and services offered fully with a view to improving their competitiveness. The EIA furthered the USAID BiH strategy on economic growth in terms of the priority to increase growth and the competitiveness of SMEs in the local, regional and global marketplace. In cooperation with the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs (NMFA), during the original period (2007-2010) the EIA established four e-BIZ centers with one in each of the following four sectors: wood processing (USAID funded), tourism (USAID funded), machine tools (NMFA funded) and agriculture (NMFA funded). Two additional USAID funded e-BIZ centers were established during the extension period (2010-2013): one to support BiH SMEs in the textile industry and the other to support various industries related to transport/logistics services.  USAID funded the establishment of four e-BIZ centers through four sub-grants or fixed obligation grants (FOG) to the following companies/legal entities: •  ‘Artisan’ (a wood processing company) to start and develop  ‘Arteco’ (a wood products e-BIZ center);  •  ‘Fondacija e-turizam’ to start and develop Exploring BiH (the tourism portal e-BIZ center);  •  ‘Kismet’ to start and develop the Textile and Technology Center (TTC) e-BIZ center to support SMEs in the textile industry; and •  ‘Satwork’ to start and develop ‘Transwork’ (the e-BIZ center aimed at supporting SMEs from various industries related to transport/logistics services). 3 

EVALUATION QUESTIONS, DESIGN, METHODS AND LIMITATIONS In order to answer the main evaluation questions, relating to areas such as increased capacity amongst e-BIZ  center  staff,  the  financial  and  operational  sustainability  of  the  e-BIZ  centers  and  increased competitiveness  of  SME  clients,  the  Evaluation  Team  performed  a  desk  review  of  the  existing documentation  created  prior  to  and  during  project  implementation.  The  team  also  carried  out preliminary interviews with management and staff from the e-BIZ centers as well as the EIA staff and conducted other key informant interviews and questionnaire surveys. The Evaluation Team compared the data collected through the surveys and interviews with the data contained in the EIA reports. The team analyzed financial statements in order to determine any changes in the financial performance indicators for the e-BIZ centers. The team used a number of financial analysis techniques to determine the level of financial sustainability of the e-BIZ centers as well as to determine potential changes in the competitiveness of the SME clients. In addition, in order to evaluate the performance of the e-BIZ centers in a comprehensive and objective manner the Evaluation Team used a balanced scorecard tool. The tool uses both non-financial and financial measures to provide a broad overview of their business performance. The team also analyzed the level of competitiveness of the client SMEs by comparing the data gathered through the surveys and interviews with that of the SME managers. The main limitations were the questionable validity and reliability of the data provided by the e-BIZ centers and the EIA, a complete  absence  of  baseline  data  on  the  indicators  relevant  to  the  evaluation  questions,  the shortcomings of “post-then-pre” methodology1, the fact that the characteristics of the comparison group could not be taken into consideration and the extremely low response rate for both groups of SMEs (client and non-client).  FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS  Each of the e-BIZ centers had a different impact on the competitiveness of the SMEs within their respective industries. Yet when considering the increased competitiveness of the SMEs the only certain thing is that the EIA significantly raised the competitiveness of e-BIZ centers’ parent companies. While it was not possible to confirm any impact on competitiveness of SMEs in the tourism sector covered by Exploring BiH, all interviewed SMEs from the logistics and transport sector confirmed that the services provided by the e-BIZ center Transwork had improved their control over their operations and thus reduced their costs.  Transwork is the only e-BIZ Center that performed as expected when it comes to the number  of  clients  served  and  its  impact  on  clients’  competitiveness.  However,  the  EIA distorted  the  market  in  logistics  and  transportation  industry  by  supporting  one of the  numerous companies that provides GPS monitoring and tracking service. The attempt was made to differentiate Transwork from other similar service providers by creating a bundle of products that does not exist as a comprehensive package of services in BiH market. However, Transwork’s sales data show that over 90% of revenues are coming from sale of GPS devices, installation of GPS devices and subscription to GPS tracking service. The E-BIZ center Arteco made quite an important contribution to the wood processing sector by creating an outsourcing opportunity for SMEs in the development of product technical documentation and prototypes. However, since the design of new products is not so frequent in BiH present demand amongst SMEs within the wood processing sector for this service remains low. Greater demand for prototype development came from foreign customers.  4 

The e-BIZ center TTC has also brought important services to the market such as fast pattern/prototype development, grading, marker making and cut precision. It is not that the technology for these operations does not exist in BiH SMEs or that they cannot operate without it, because all of these operations can be done manually, but rather that the existing process is slow and the precision of the cut is not high. In addition, when the SMEs receive clothing patterns in digital form they usually do not have the ability to access them and transfer them to material; this is the point where TTC steps in.  As one of the interviewed SME owners stated, “Given that we have no ICT capacity required we would never get a job with our present foreign client. However, we were able to convince them that we have the necessary ICT capacity by showing that we use the services of TTC as our ICT resource center”.  Almost 90% of BiH textile companies work for foreign customers on basic cutting and sewing operations based on received patterns; however, ICT capacities in the majority of these companies are non-existent. Therefore, if adequately mentored and managed, TTC could become the ICT resource center for many BiH textile companies presently without any ICT capacity. Unfortunately,  after  being  operational  for  almost  two  years  TTC’s  outreach  remains  low  and  it continues to use its resources mainly in support of production in its parent company.   EIA management of the M&E system was poor. The EIA invested little or no effort to establish baseline data or track changes in the competitiveness of SMEs within the targeted industries. The Evaluation Team effort to reconstruct this data through an SME survey failed due to the extremely low response rate amongst the e-BIZ centers’ clients. In the Start-up Implementation and Annual Work Plan2 the proposed method for tracking increases in the competitiveness of SMEs is the number of customers that report that e-BIZ center services have strengthened their business through increased productivity, increased sales, decreased costs and other improvements.  The plan was that the EIA perform annual surveys in order to determine any changes in the above-mentioned indicator. The EIA was expected to perform the first survey of this kind after the first year of the centers’ operations. Yet during preliminary and informal interviews conducted with the EIA, on June 24 2013, EIA staff stated they had not performed the survey through which customers could report whether or not their business had been strengthened by using the services of the e-BIZ centers.   Despite the fact that this survey is included in the EIA M&E plan as well as in the Data Quality Assessment as one of the major tools for tracking EIA progress, there is no evidence that the EIA surveyed customers of all four e-BIZ centers after the first year of the Activity. The e-BIZ centers for which the Evaluation Team can confirm that they have performed this survey are Transwork and Arteco. Arteco hired an external consultant to perform this survey.  On July 17 the Evaluation Team sent a Request for Information to the EIA (see Annex 5) asking for a report on “the results of the surveys of the e-BIZ centers SME clients“ performed after the first year of center operations (see question 3.4), as specified in the Start-Up Implementation Plan.                                                  2 Start-Up and Implementation Annual Work Plan; DOT-ORG BiH Excellence in Innovation Project; Academy for Educational Development; USAID/BIH Excellence in Innovation Cooperative Agreement Award No. 168-A-00-07-00101-00 8 February 2008. 5 

The Evaluation Team received a folder titled 'E-BIZ Center's First Year Clients' Survey’ on July 26; however, a subsequent review of the submitted documentation revealed that the documents had been created on 25.07.2013. The review of the documents also resulted in the following findings:   three of the surveys were done by the e-BIZ centers and only one by the EIA (although oaccording to the project documentation the surveys were the obligation of EIA);   the questionnaires used were typical customer satisfaction questionnaires with little or ono questions related to the impact that the services of the e-BIZ centers had had on their customers’ competitiveness (despite the fact that the impact that the e-BIZ centers had on their clients competitiveness was the main purpose of the survey); and   the only survey conducted by the EIA, in addition to the e-BIZ center clients, also ointerviewed potential e-BIZ center clients i.e., SMEs interviewed during the market survey. The EIA invested a lot of effort in order to increase the capacity of the e-BIZ centers to attract and retain customers; e-BIZ center staff evaluated the training and direct technical assistance as good and helpful. Sales and marketing were the areas that the EIA gave highest priority. Capacity building activities related to sales and marketing ranged from two organized trainings3 on marketing, the provision of technical assistance for the development of marketing plans and the provision of advisory on-the-job assistance. Only Arteco e-BIZ Center staff expressed reservations about the value of certain marketing methods they had been asked to use (promotion and marketing via e-mail).  However,  the  number,  frequency  and  staff  coverage  of  the  group  trainings/seminars organized by the EIA could have been higher. A few organized group seminars related to marketing and financial management were organized; however, Transwork4 and TTC staff did not attend any of these marketing and financial management trainings and the EIA did not make any effort to repeat them after the two new e-BIZ centers had been established and included in the Activity. Capacity building efforts to increase e-BIZ center staff knowledge and skills in areas of high impact  information  and  communication  technology  and  services  were  basic  and insufficient. The quality of human resources is the key success factor that will determine an e-BIZ centers ability to become a center of excellence for the dissemination, transfer and application of high impact ICT in the target industries. It is the highly educated employees with top-notch expertise in the application of ICT and the capacity to provide continuous new and innovative services within their respective industries that affords e-BIZ centers their sole competitive advantage and makes them unique and different from other manufacturing shops, in contrast to easily replicable equipment and services.                                                  3 BiH Entrepreneurship and Business Development Seminar (a one-day seminar on marketing strategy, customer/ service protocols, effective networking etc.) held on 31.08.2010 and Power of Sales (a two-day seminar) held 30-31.03.2011. 4 The Activity in its 2011 Annual Report reported false statement that, beside Satwork’s owner, Transwork staff also attended this two-day seminar. Please see page 3 of the Annual Report for the period January – December 2011. 6 

Many factors prevented the buildup of the e-BIZ centers’ top quality teams. The first relates to insufficient attention and effort to provide training for e-BIZ center staff in ICT and ICT applications in specific industries. Having in mind that e-BIZ centers are supposed to be centers of excellence for the dissemination and transfer of new high impact information and communication technologies, the EIA has done too little to build e-BIZ center staff knowledge and skills in the application of high impact ICT.  The second one is the remote geographic location of two e-BIZ centers (Arteco and TTC) which limited their ability to attract employees with university level education. A review of the CVs of e-BIZ center staff revealed that, with the exception of Transwork, all e-BIZ center staff had a rather low average level of education attainment. In addition, in the majority of cases their previous working experience had little relevance for the functions they perform within the e-BIZ centers.  The third factor relates to the roles and responsibilities parent companies assign to the e-BIZ centers. Transwork is a case in point. Transwork’s primary role in parent company Satwork is marketing and sales. Thus, employees hired for the Transwork e-BIZ center were skilled primarily in marketing and sales, not ICT or logistics, as needed to achieve the goals of this e-BIZ center. EIA’s capacity building efforts to increase the knowledge and skills of e-BIZ center staff should have been stronger and a priority.  The  TTC  and  Arteco  e-BIZ  centers  were  the  only  ones  to  build  technology  related capacities. These two e-BIZ centers received machines and equipment as well as training on how to operate them from the producers of the machines/equipment. The other two e-BIZ centers and their staff did not participate in any type activity related to technology skills capacity building. Nevertheless,  surveys  and  interviews  where  e-BIZ  center  employees  self-reported  on improvements in their knowledge and skills indicated that the EIA increased the capacity of e-BIZ center staff. Interviews and a questionnaire survey of e-BIZ center employees confirmed that they were confident in their own capacity to perform their jobs at top performance level. The majority of staff had received some form of training and reported positive improvements in certain skills. Yet Exploring BiH did not have any employees except for the Director, while TTC and Transwork staff did not attend marketing and financial management trainings.   EIA project staff provided most technical assistance in the form of day-to-day hands on capacity building. The EIA performed exactly as stated in the Start-Up plan, “The Project will undertake focused training and technical assistance (T&TA) most of which will be provided to the e-BIZ centers by EIA Project staff for day-to-day hands-on and in-depth capacity building”.5 The e-BIZ center staff evaluated this technical assistance as useful.  Operational management - The Evaluation Team could not confirm any capacity building assistance directly targeted at improving managerial skills or in adopting and integrating technology in order to gain maximum efficiency and productivity. The Evaluation Team was also unable to confirm any capacity building assistance directly targeted at improving knowledge and skills in other management areas  i.e., strategic planning and human resource management.                                                 5Start-Up and Implementation Annual Work Plan; DOT-ORG BiH Excellence in Innovation Project; Academy for Educational Development; USAID BIH Excellence in Innovation Cooperative Agreement Award No. 168-A-00-07-00101-00 8 February 2008. 7 

All four e-BIZ centers are financially sustainable - This conclusion is based on a simplified and narrow definition of financial sustainability as provided in the Start-Up and Implementation Annual Work Plan6. It is also based on an analysis of e-BIZ center financial reports7 that, in the case of TTC and Arteco, were adjusted during the course of this evaluation, while the background caveat shows that a significant part or the majority of the e-BIZ centers’8 revenue came from their parent companies. After a request for documentation was placed by the Evaluation Team we received financial statements for all years of operations of the e-BIZ centers. The Evaluation Team also asked for the semi-annual financial statements prepared up until the end of June 2013.  In the case of Arteco, the EIA, on its own initiative, submitted new financial reports the following month that covered the month of July 2013. These two financial statements were fundamentally different and indicated structural changes in business operations. If, for example, we look at the structure of liabilities and more specifically the liabilities towards the related legal entities9 we can see that on June 30 2013 they amounted to 118,000 BAM. Looking back through the previous annual financial statements the Evaluation Team determined that this amount of liability had existed since the beginning of the Activity. The parent company, Artisan, created this liability. Instead of contributing capital to Arteco, as it was obliged to according to the Fixed Obligations Grant, Artisan gave money to Arteco in the form of a loan.  After June 30 2013, in an attempt to improve its financial position, Arteco suddenly eliminated this liability from the balance sheet, compensating for it through the accounts receivable that Artisan owed Arteco for the services provided. The result of this accounting exercise was a decrease in Arteco’s total assets to the amount of 109,429 BAM or 47.06%. The amount of 118,000 BAM that was supposed to be part of the agreed contribution (cost-share) of the owner to the Activity was thus transformed into a liability of the e-BIZ center to its founder.

(Artisan)  BIZ C t         (2) Loan amounting to 118,000 Figure 1: Arteco  ’s balance sheet adjustment for the period June 30 - July 30 2013.                                                 6 “Definition of sustainable: At the end of the project, each e-BIZ Center has: (a) an annual operational and financial plan that is based on past performance, which demonstrates that the Center will reach the break-even point within one year of the end of the project; (b) the e-BIZ owner’s written commitment to continuing operations of the e-BIZ Center operations after the end of the project” 7 The interview with Arteco’s management wherein they stated that they were asked to adjust their financial reports was audio recorded. 8 Also in the case of TTC and Arteco 9 Since Artisan and Arteco should, in line with the Project, be two independent legal entities and not a parent-child business this method of accounting entry is also incorrect. 8 

If the parent companies are taken out from equation then both Arteco and TTC are not financial sustainable. TTC generates between 80% (2012) and 90% (2013) of its total revenue through services provided to its parent company, Kismet d.o.o, and to Vocal Productions d.o.o. Arteco generates about one-third of its total revenue by providing services to its parent company, Artisan d.o.o.   All of the e-BIZ centers, with the exception of Transwork, had poor financial stability. Other types of financial analysis, such as Z-Score and the Kralicek Quick Test, indicated that all of the e-BIZ centers, except for Transwork, had issues with financial stability.    The e-BIZ centers did not achieve the financial benchmarks set in their respective business plans.  For example, the business plan projections for TTC’s revenue were not achieved. Similarly, Arteco failed to achieve the financial projections and target capital values specified in its business plan.    The financial reporting system for the e-BIZ centers was inadequate. The e-BIZ centers were never instructed in how to record the USAID and parent company contribution in their financial statements. The Evaluation Team was not in a position to verify the amounts and structure of the cost-share contribution from the founders of the e-BIZ centers.  When  it  came  to  operational  sustainability,  according  to  the  definition  from  the Cooperative Agreement, each e-BIZ center must be operationally sustainable10 i.e., each e-BIZ center must have a business plan.  However, each e-BIZ center has different operational capacities to achieve its vision. The level of operational capacity/sustainability depends on the level of dependence on the respective parent company. An e-BIZ centre with a high level of dependence on its parent company equates to less embedded capacity. For example, the e-BIZ center Transwork has no capacity  in  the  area  of  information  and  communication  technology  design,  development  and implementation. All technological capacity rests with the parent company Satwork, while Transwork acts solely as a sales and marketing department of its parent company. Exploring BiH has no capacity at all within itself or within its legal founder.  Transwork is the only e-BIZ center that achieved its targeted number of clients. TTC did not even manage to achieve 50% of its targeted number of clients. According to data received from its accountant, Exploring BiH did not manage to achieve the targeted number of 70 clients. Finally, Arteco served many clients but only 38 SMEs from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The majority of services provided by the e-BIZ centers were not new or non-existent in the market. All of the services provided by TTC were either already present or can be done manually. The main contribution of TTC’s services to some of its clients came in the form of precision tailoring and faster production. Prototype development was the only unique service provided by Arteco. Transwork services can be provided by a dozen other service providers, while Exploring BiH is perceived as just another small travel agency. The results of the SME questionnaire survey also confirmed that although awareness of the services provided by the e-BIZ centers was high the majority of SMEs did not consider these services to be new or previously non-existent in the market.                                                 10 Operational sustainability is defined as a, “Center has a business plan or annual operations plan that defines its offerings and the revenue needed for self-sustainability by the end of the project”.   9 

Financial data on changes in the volume of sales of SMEs that received services from the e-BIZ  centers  does  not  constitute  the  basis  for  the  conclusion  that  the  e-BIZ  centers improved the competitiveness of their clients. In all four sectors almost half of the SMEs that received SME services experienced a decrease in their total volume of sales or did not experience any change in total sales volume. The Evaluation Team could not find evidence that the e-BIZ centers had an impact on associations. One of the reasons for this could be the attempt by the e-BIZ centers to use the trade associations as a marketing channel through which to sell their services. In addition, it might be the case that the associations and the public sector alike perceived the entire project as a private company endeavor.  The Evaluation Team could not find evidence that the e-BIZ centers had had any impact on the sectors/industries. Financial data on profitability in all four sectors did not indicate any significant improvement in the competitiveness of the target industries.  According to existing studies, over the period 2009-2011 there was no increase in total employment in the wood processing sector. In contrast, the entire sector lost 17% of total jobs during the period 2008-2009.11 Part of this could be attributed to the general economic downturn; however, the Evaluation Team could not find any evidence that the EIA had had any impact on increasing employment in the wood processing industry.                                                 11 BiH Industrial Outlook for 2012: Wood and Metal Processing Sectors; Fostering Interventions For Market Advancement (FIRMA) September 2012. 10
